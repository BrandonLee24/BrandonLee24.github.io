# Offense

<br>

## Quarterback (3)

-Tyrod Taylor

-Baker Mayfield

-Drew Stanton

<br>

## Running Back (3)

-Carlos Hyde

-Duke Johnson

-Nick Chubb

<br>

## Wide Receiver (6)

-Jarvis Landry

-Josh Gordon

-Antonio Callaway

-Rashard Higgins

-Damion Ratley

-Derrick Willies

<br>

## Tight End (4)

-David Njoku

-Darren Fells

-Seth Devalve

-Orson Charles

<br>

## Offensive Line (9)

-Joel Bitonio

-Austin Corbett

-J.C. Tretter

-Kevin Zeitler

-Chris Hubbard

-Desmond Harrison

-Earl Watford

-Austin Reiter

-Greg Robinson

<br>

The main surprises here are that Orson Charles makes the team while Dan Vitale, Devon Cajuste, and Spencer Drango do not. 

<br>

# Defense

<br>

## Defensive Line

-Myles Garrett

-Larry Ogunjobi

-Trevon Coley

-Emmanuel Ogbah

-Chris Smith

-Jamie Meder

-Chad Thomas

-Carl Nassib

-Devaroe Lawrence

<br>

## Linebacker

-Jamie Collins

-Joe Schobert

-Christian Kirksey

-Genard Avery

-James Burgess

-Jermaine Grace

<br>

## Cornerback

-Denzel Ward

-Terrance Mitchell

-T.J. Carrie

-E.J. Gaines

-Denzel Rice

-Jeremiah McKinnon

<br>

## Safety

-Jabrill Peppers

-Damarious Randall

-Derrick Kindred

-Briean Boddy-Calhoun

<br>

Despite a pick 6 against the Lions, Nate Orchard misses the cut. Former 6th round pick Caleb Brantley is a big surprise and many believed rookie Simeon Thomas would make the roster. Mike Jordan was another cornerback I was surpised to see go.

<br>

# Special Teams

-Zane Gonzalez

-Britton Colquitt

-Charley Hughlett

<br>

No real surpise here, Gonzalez and Colquitt win their camp battles and remain with the team for another year.
