## Two Defensive Starters Lost For Year

<br>

Both Christian Kirksey and E.J. Gaines have been lost for the season, a devastating blow to a defense that has already been rattled with injuries. Kirksey, the teams starting outside linebacker had moved inside with Joe Schobert's injury, taking over play calling duties and remaining a leader for the team. Gaines had taken over as the teams second cornerback with Terrance Williams' injury but suffered two concussions in 3 weeks.

Kirksey, who has dealt with injuries all season, hurt his hamstring in the second half against the Chiefs. Kirksey is a 5th year veteran and a team captain, starting 7 games this year totaling 29 tackles, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery.

Gaines, who signed with the Browns this offseason, appeared in 6 games, starting two, and totaled 3 passes defended and an interception.

The Browns will hope to return Joe Schobert soon, who would take over play calling duties again in the center of the defense. They also must pray Denzel Ward is capable of playing the rest of the season and that Terrance Mitchell returns to the field soon. Damarious Randall will likely play cornerback in the time being, with Briean Boddy-Calhoun filling in at saftey.

The Browns signed Juston Burris from the Jets practice squad, a 2016 fourth round pick that has seen action in 4 games this year. Burris is a product of Raleigh, N.C. and played collegiately at North Carolina State.
