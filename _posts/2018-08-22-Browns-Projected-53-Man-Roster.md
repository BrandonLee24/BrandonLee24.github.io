As the Cleveland Browns wrapped up training camp and are set to gear up for their third preseason game, I predict the Browns 53 man roster, describing why some players make it and why others don't.

<br>

## Offense

<br>

### Quarterback (3)

Tyrod Taylor

Baker Mayfield

Drew Stanton 

Missed the Cut - Brogan Roback

<br>

Taylor commands the starting position, the first overall pick Baker Mayfield has shined, and Stanton's experience and leadership wraps up the quarterback spot. Undrafted free agent Brogan Roback has yet to take a snap in a preseason game and bearing an injury will not make the cut.

<br>

### Running Back (4)

Carlos Hyde

Duke Johnson

Nick Chubb

Dan Vitale

Missed the Cut - Matthew Dayes, Dontrell Hillard

<br>

Hyde shined in the second preseason game, displaying his ability out of the backfield. We all know what Johnson is capable and rookie Nick Chubb has flashed immense talent throughout the offseason. Dayes was on the team last year and could sneak on if he shines on special teams or the team decides not to keep a fullback. Vitale has been the teams fullback the past 2 years but it's up to Todd Haley whether he sticks around.

<br>

### Wide Receiver (6)

Jarvis Landry

Josh Gordon

Antonio Callaway

Rashard Higgins

Damion Ratley

Jeff Janis

Missed the Cut - C.J. Board, Derek Willies, Evan Berry, Da'Mari Scott, Blake Jackson

<br>

A position group which was unimpressive last season was revamped by the addition of Jarvis Landry and the return of Josh Gordon. Callaway has flashed skills, Higgins has stepped his game up, and the 6'3 Ratley is very capable. Janis makes the team simply due to special teams contributions but is not a lock. C.J. Board has been solid throughout camp and could sneak on the roster or the practice team. Da'Mari Scott could be another practice squad player.

<br>

### Tight End (4)

David Njoku

Darren Fells

Seth Devalve

Devon Cajuste

Missed the Cut - Orson Charles, Stephen Baggett

<br>

Njoku is the young talent, while Fells is the witty veteran. Devalve has showcased the ability to be a passing threat but a quadricepts injury has kept him from playing so far. Cajuste sneaks in here due to his special teams ability and Devalves injuries. 

<br>

### Offensive Lineman (9)

Joel Bitonio

Austin Corbett

J.C. Tretter

Kevin Zeitler

Chris Hubbard

Desmond Harrison

Spencer Drango

Austin Reiter

Shon Coleman

Missed the Cut - Greg Robinson, Christian DiLauro, Kevin Bowen, Avery Gennesy, Fred Lauina, Geoff Gray, Anothony Fabino

<br>

No real surprises to this group other then undrafted free agent Desmond Harrison, a left tackle who has shined all offseason. Shon Coleman, who was demoted to the second team early in camp, makes it over Greg Robinson due to versatility but I wouldn't be surprised if the Browns traded Coleman and kept Robinson.

<br>

### Defensive Lineman (9)

Myles Garrett

Larry Ogunjobi

Trevon Coley

Emmanuel Ogbah

Chris Smith

Chad Thomas

Caleb Brantley

Jamie Meder

Carl Nassib

Missed the Cut - Nate Orchard, Marcell Frazier, Lenny Jones, Jeremy Faulk, Blaine Woodson, Zaycoven Henderson, Daniel Ekuale

<br>

Despite being featured on Hard Knocks, Nate Orchard misses the cut due to veteran Chris Smith and rookie Chad Thomas. Nassib is capable and earns a spot due to potential and more proven ability then Orchard. Jeremy Faulk could be the surpise defensive tackle to make it but Ogunjobi, Coley, and Brantley are so youthful and talented and Meder has been around so long that it would be shocking for Faulk to make it.

<br>

### Linebacker (6)

Jamie Collins

Christian Kirksey

Joe Schobert

Mychal Kendricks

Genard Avery

James Burgess

Missed the Cut - Justin Currie, B.J. Bello, Jermaine Grace, Brady Sheldon

<br>

After bulking up and switching from a saftey to a linebacker, Currie just misses out as rookie Genard Avery and utility man James Burgess make it over him. The other 4 are guarentees and will all see the field plenty. 

<br>

### Cornerback (5)

Denzel Ward

Terrance Mitchell

T.J. Carrie

E.J. Gaines

Simeon Thomas

Missed the Cut - Jeremiah McKinnon, Mike Jordan, Denzel Rice, Christian Boutte.

<br>

Despite an injury which will sideline him for 3 weeks, E.J. Gaines makes it due to past experience and his proven ability. Rookie Simeon Thomas makes the team with his 6'3 frame. Jeremiah McKinnon has impressed this offseason as well and could find himself on the practice squad. The team truly has 6 corners as Briean Boddy-Calhoun is more then capable to command a spot here but is listed as a saftey for now.

<br>

### Saftey (4)

Damarious Randall

Jabrill Peppers

Derrick Kindred 

Briean Boddy-Calhoun

Missed the Cut - Derron Smith, Elijah Campbell, Tigle Sankoh, Montrel Meander

<br>

Randall, Peppers, and Kindred are guarentees, and Calhoun will make the team 100%, but whether it is as a saftey or a cornerback is unknown. Either way, the Browns secondary will be much improved this season.

<br>

### Special Teams (3)

Britton Colquitt

Zane Gonzalez

Charley Hughlett

Missed the Cut - Justin Vogel, Ross Martin

<br>

Colquitt has been solid the past 2 years with the Browns and Hughlett is a lock to be the teams long snapper. Gonzalez improved last season and gets the nod with his booming leg.
