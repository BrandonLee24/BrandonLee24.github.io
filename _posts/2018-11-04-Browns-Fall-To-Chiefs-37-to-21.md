The Kansas City Chiefs have defeated the Cleveland Browns 37-21 to improve to an 8-1 record. The Browns fall to 2-6-1 in Gregg Williams' first game as the teams head coach.

Baker Mayfield completed 28 of 41 passes for 288 yards, 2 touchdowns, and one interceptions. His favorite target of the day was Duke Johnson, who totaled 9 receptions for 78 yards and 2 touchdowns. Nick Chubb had 85 yards on 22 carries and 1 touchdown. Other performances of note were Genard Avery and Myles Garrett each notching sacks and Denzel Rice grabbing his first career interception. Gregg Joseph also connected on a 51 yard field goal, a new career long.

Damarious Randall and Desmond Harrison were inactive for this game. E.J. Gaines left early in the contest and was soon joined by rookie phenom Denzel Ward with neither returning to the contest. The Browns already have struggled with injuries in the defense and their depth was tested today. The Browns play the Falcons next week at home before finally reaching their bye week.

Freddie Kitchens' offense totaled almost 400 yards, an impressive statistic for a brand new offensive coordinator. Against a solid defense and a short amount of time to prepare, Kitchens formed a solid game plan with decent execution. The Browns also only committed 4 penalties on the day, much improved compared to previous weeks. Gregg Williams will look to regroup and get set to face off versus the Atlanta Falcons.
