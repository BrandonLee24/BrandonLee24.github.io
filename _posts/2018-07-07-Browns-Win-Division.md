The Cleveland Browns, that's right the team whom has not won a game since 2016, have a real chance to win the AFC North. Despite being tied for the lowest projected win total with the other Ohio team, the Cincinnati Bengals, I and many others believe this team has a real chance. Listed below are a few reasons why.

<br>

## New Energy

Tyrod Taylor, Jarvis Landry, Demarious Randall, and more new faces have brought in, all of which have winning experience. Taylor led the Bills to the playoffs last season and will expect a lot more from his team then past quarterbacks for the Browns have. Behind him, the number 1 draft pick, Baker Mayfield, played in the college football playoffs last season as well. These two, along with Drew Stanton and Landry will bring a new energy to this offense and will implement a winning culture. Defensively, Randall experienced success with the Packers for multiple years and rookie Denzel Ward never experienced a losing record in college. With these new additions as well as coaching changes, the Browns will have a new energy and intensity.

## Competition

At every position, including punter and kicker, the Browns have brought in new faces and forced player to compete for roster spots, no longer allowing lackadasical players to make the team. This pushes every player and thins off the extras, even if a player is sure they will make the roster due to a contract, they must work for playing time. Competition is fierce at 2 of the most vital positions, quarterback and cornerback, with every player pushing for time. The saying, "hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard", will be especially true this season, talent alone will not get you anywhere with these Browns, no more Kenny Britt.

## Pressure

The Browns felt the pressure all last season, following a 1-15 performance, the team was pressured to force players into games and take incredible risks. Deshone Kizer never should have played last year except the Browns had no other viable options. This year, no rookie is pressured to start and Hue Jackson and the staff know this, they have no desire to force any player into the game. The team also should not feel much pressure as they cannot do worse then last year, even if they only tied 1 game this season, it would still be an improvement.
