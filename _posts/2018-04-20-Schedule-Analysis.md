## Review

After going 1-31 the past 2 seasons, any Browns fan would take a 7-9 record. While the Browns aquired multiple new starters, most notably Tyrod Taylor and Jarvis Landry, they still should not be expected to make the playoffs this season. This record is quite optimistic, but with stable quarterback play and a plethora of draft picks, the Browns should capitalize and change the culture in Cleveland.
