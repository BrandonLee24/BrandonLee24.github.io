## Joel Bitonio

<br>

With the 35th pick of the 2014 draft, the Cleveland Browns selected Wisconsin lineman Joel Bitonio and he has held down the left guard position ever since. Despite injury issues in 2015 and 2016 causing him to miss 17 games, Bitonio was signed to a 5 year, 51 million dollar contract extension prior to last season. He started every game last season at left guard and looked to do the same this season, but with Joe Thomas' retirement and lackluster showings from Shon Coleman and others at the left tackle position, Bitonio is set to move back to his college position. It's risky, but the Browns have preached playing the best 5 lineman, so if it means Bitonio will leave his comfort zone and eye a new role in the offense, by all means the coaches will explore the option. Cleveland had stated countless times that this was the last possible option, but apparently after a week of camp they reached the conclusion that this was for the best.

## Austin Corbett

<br>

With Bitonio sliding outside to the left tackle position, the Browns 33rd pick this year now appears to be set to take over Bitonio's vacated spot at left guard. Corbett and Bitonio were once teammated at Nevada and the duo looks to build on that past chemistry and fortify the Browns offensive front. In Corbett falters, Spencer Drango would be next in line to take over the guard spot, a position he is more than capable filling in. Hopefully, the transition for both Bitonio and Corbett is seamless, but it is a big risk taking players out of their comfort zone and starting rookies so early.

## Trade

<br>

The move of Joel Bitonio may be temporary if John Dorsey eyes a left tackle and trades for them. Multiple options exist and the Browns could expend a few players or draft picks to aquire a proven left tackle. Donald Penn, the 35 year old Raider, could be a filler option for a few years. With over 170 career starts, Penn could immediatley control the position and with his age and the Raiders recent selection of Kolton Miller, it may only take a draft pick to aquire his talents. Cameron Fleming, signed by the Cowboys this offseason, could be a long shot as well. It would take more to aquire the former Patriot, but if the Browns are desperate I could see them be willing to give up draft picks and/or talented players for a starting caliber left tackle. Lastly, don't give up on Shon Coleman, Desmond Harrison, Greg Robinson, or any others competing for the spot, while Bitonio may be commanding the position for the forseeable future, the Browns coaches are simply playing out every option. Coleman still has room to grow, Harrison and Robinson have been dealing with injuries, and even Austin Corbett could return to his college position, you simply never know with the National Football Leauge.
