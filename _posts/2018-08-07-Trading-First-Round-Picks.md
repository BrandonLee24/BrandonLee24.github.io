With the recent trade of former first round pick Corey Coleman to the Bills, the Browns no longer have a single first round selection from 2012-2016. During that time, they drafted 8 players, two of which were released and the other 6 traded for much less value then they were initially worth. This begs the question, with so much value placed on first rounders, is it more worth to trade for proven players instead of taking the risk on hitting another bust?

## Top 5 Selection

When a team has a top 5, maybe even top 10 depending on talent, I believe they should take their swing and attempt to draft a generational talent, such as Myles Garrett. If one of these picks doesn't pan out it can be devastating to a franchise but teams have the best odds with these picks and usually there are a few players who are almost guarentees. If there is ever a Myles Garrett on the draft board, take the chance, those players do not appear often and are clearly talented.

## Middle of the round

Players selected in the middle of the first round are often hit or miss and it can be tough to tell how a player will develop. My best advice, take the best player available not the best fit, that increases the odds the player will pan out and if you already have a loaded position group, you can move those assets and aquire talent at other positions or more draft picks. If the top players on the board all have major question marks, trade the pick, first rounders have immense value and you could potentially swap one first rounder for a plethora of picks the next offseason.

## End of the round

The Patriots seem to do this every year, trading or moving their picks at the end of the first round for proven talent rather then take a swing on a player when you have no clue who will remain on the board until it is actually your selection. Why not trade a late first rounder for a talented and proven NFL starter, it's much more likely they will continue to grow and produce rather then a rookie. If no trade fits, again take the best player available.
