## Quarterback

<br>

### Starter: Tyrod Taylor

After trading a 2018 third round pick, the Browns aquired Taylor and his talents, truly stabalizing the position for the first time in years. By aquiring the player who led the Bills to the playoffs last season, the Browns will ensure no rookie quarterback is thrown out into the fire which is the NFL. Taylor is signed through next season, but if he does well and displays enough skill, the Browns could extend his contract and allow further development for a rookie quarterback.


#### Roster Chance: 100%

<br>

### Backup: Drew Stanton

Signed to a 2 year deal, Stanton will serve as a mentor for whomever the browns draft, as well as insurance that if Taylor goes down, no rookie will be thrusted out onto the field. Despite not posting the greatest of numbers, the 33 year-old Stanton will be valuable to the Browns, helping on and off the field and teaching a drafted quarterback some things.


#### Roster Chance: 95%

<br>

### Additional Aquisitions

Following the trades of Cody Kessler and Kevin Hogan, the Browns only have 2 quarterbacks on their roster. As predicted by most, I see and believe the Browns must draft a quarterback with the first pick, allow them to sit and learn for the first year at least, and eventually slowly hand them the reigns. Whether they take Sam Darnold, Josh Allen, Josh Rosen, or Baker Mayfield with the first pick, it is crucial that they allow them to sit and learn. I also belive the Browns should draft a late round quarterback or pickup one whom goes undrafted to increase camp arms and competition. If the Browns see something in whomever they sign, they could place them on the practice squad.

### Position Grade - B

Despite the aquisitons, Taylor has never been able to raise his ceiling, and Stanton has been extremely inconsistent and struggles to run an NFL offense. While this is by far the best this position has been in years, there is still room to improve, starting with the draft and the development of a rookie quarterback.
