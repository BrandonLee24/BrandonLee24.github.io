## The Great Debate

<br>

Josh Gordon, since entering the league in 2012, has "flashed" more then just superstar potential, the 6'3 menace could be one of the greatest receivers ever. "Could be" is the key phrase there, as the former Baylor star has struggled with suspensions the past 3 years after leading the league with 1,646 yards in just 14 games in 2013. Flash Gordon is a generational talent with incredible size and speed, but as he shared yesterday, he is still struggling with anxiety. In previous years, Gordon would drink and smoke to stave off this feeling, but with no more room to slip up, the Browns have been praying their star could keep it together. Below, I will look at a few options the Browns could take in addressing the Josh Gordon hassle.

<br>

### Option 1: Wait on Gordon

Gordon has no timetable for a return as he takes some time away from the team, but he does have the support of the organization and the fans, all of whom hope to see the 2013 reception leader achieve that level again. While there is some uncertaintey, Gordon has not slipped up since returning for the final 5 games last year and the Browns should hope he can continue to keep his life together. John Dorsey has not showed much disipline before, opting to bring in new players at almost every position instead of waiting to see if anyone can improve, but with Gordon being a generational talent, expect Dorsey to hold out.

### Option 2: Trade For Another Receiver

The Browns have picks they could potentially trade, and while a blockbuster move for a top talent such as Odell Beckham Jr is unlikely, the Browns could still trade some late round selections or conditional picks to strengthen the corps. The Patriots have allegedly been shopping Malcom Mitchell, and with his injury history and the trade history between New England and Cleveland, the Browns could potentially swap a late round conditional pick for the former Georgia Bulldog. Other options are out there as well, such as Brandon Coleman for the Saints or Kevin White with the Bears. If Dorsey is impatient or believes there is a high risk Gordon never plays again, expect him to be aggressive in adding another body to the position group.

### Option 3: Corey Coleman or Antonio Callaway

John Dorsey and Hue Jackson could opt to push both the young receivers and tell them to "prove it". While risky as neither has proven themselves to this date, it may be the only option for the Browns until Gordon works everything out. Coleman has suffered numerous injuries the past 2 years, but the former first round pick has the talent to develop into a NFL starter. Callaway has not played in 2 years but would have been a first round selection had he stayed out of trouble at Florida. With the Browns he has flashed big time potential but there is still a risk and the Browns would prefer not to rush him onto the field.

### Option 4: Emergence

Jeff Janis, Rashard Higgins, C.J. Board, Ricardo Louis, Damion Rantley, one of these recievers could have the chance to earn meaningful playing time if Gordon is unable to find the field again. Board has reportedly been impressive throughout the Browns offseason activities, with the same being said of 6th round pick Ratley. While both are young, one could step up into the light and play a role in the Browns offense this coming season. Janis, a former Packer, could play a bigger role in the offense as well. The whole group has potential, but if Gordon goes down, one or more of the young talents will need to step up.
