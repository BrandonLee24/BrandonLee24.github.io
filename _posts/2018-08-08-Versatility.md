In the NFL, versatility is huge, players must be able to constantly adapt and adjust to opposing schemes and players. The Browns coaches focus on this, demanding players to learn how to play at least 2 positions and forcing them to leave their comfort zone. Defensively, linebackers may find themselves out wide covering receivers or on the line blitzing and they must be comfortable in doing so. Cleveland has keyed in and the players who bought into this concept will reap the benefits.

Briean Boddy-Calhoun is a phenomenal example of this, as the defensive back can play in the slot, out wide, or line up as saftey. This is huge as in games you are not always able to sub and players with this versatility make it easier to adapt. Also, if another player suffers an injury, the coaching staff knows it has the capability to plug Boddy-Calhoun in almost anywhere.

For defensive lineman, this can be crucial and can determine whether a player makes the team. Myles Garrett may be one of, if not the best young defensive end, but if he is not capable of rushing from both sides and even up the middle, teams will be able to scheme for him and shut him down. The defensive line must be able to give opposing offenses multiple looks and if a stud player like Garrett is being stuffed on the right, it can be beneficial to have the ability to switch him to the left and allow him to get a new look.

Offensive lineman may have to deal with the same thing, when an injury occurs someone must step up, no matter where along the line it occurs. Hue Jackson preaches that he will play his best 5 lineman so they all must be capable of commanding at least 1 position. Spencer Drango is the Browns mobile man along the offensive front, as he has seen time at tackle and guard in the NFL and will fill in anywhere in short notice. These players are invaluable to an NFL franchise.
