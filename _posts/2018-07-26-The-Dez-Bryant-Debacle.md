## Dez Bryant

Recently, the former Dallas Cowboy star has been linked with the Browns, seen as a potential replacement if Josh Gordon in unable to return. A few years ago, this would be a massive ordeal, as Bryant was a probowler. Today, as seen by the lack of interest in the 29 year old, Bryant remains a free agent with little interest from other teams. Listed the below are a few reasons the Browns should and should not aquire Bryant and his talents.

<br>

### Why they Should:

<br>

#### Tap into potential

The former Oklahoma State receiver has posted three 1,000 yard seasons and has averaged 14 yards per catch over 8 seasons. He also has been able to stay healthy throughout his career and is a proven player. In Dallas, Bryant played in 3 playoff games as well, adding to the winning culture the Browns front office hopes to bring in.

#### Former Number 1

If Josh Gordon is unable to play, Jarvis Landry will be the Browns lead receiver, but behind him is lackluster. Dez was the Cowboys top option for years and could take some pressure off Landry and the quarterback with his presence. He also could be a viable red zone threat as he stands at 6'2". 

<br>

#### Only 29

Dez Bryant is only 29 and with little interest from other teams, the Browns could sign him to a cheap prove it deal, likely just 1 year, allowing them to fill a starting position temporarily instead of rushing Antonio Callaway onto the field or another young player. Last season, the Browns receivers were poor at best and Dorsey has show he does not like to wait and see if something comes to fruition, he takes action quickly.

<br>

### Why they Shouldn't:

<br>

#### Locker Room Issues

Dez Bryant has always had issues in the locker room, causing turmoil and having an inflated head. The Browns have been attempting to change their culture and infuse their roster with leaders and determined players and Bryant has not shown to be a hard worker often slacking off and not giving 100%. With the culture the Browns hope to have, why add a trouble maker in Bryant, it simply does not add up and he would likely have a negative impact on the team.

<br>

#### Steady Decline

Since he racked up 1320 yards and 16 touchdowns in 2014, Dez Bryants performance has dipped, leading to him being cut by the Cowboys this offseason. Since his all-pro season, Bryant has only scored 17 total touchdowns and hasnt reached 900 yards. While only 29, Bryant is past his prime and it's unlikely he would ever perform up to that all-pro level again.

<br>

#### Youth

The Browns are infused with youth at every position, so why add an aging veteran when your young talent could be learning and growing. Bryant would simply be filling in and taking experience and playing time from others such as Antonio Callaway, Rashard Higgins, CJ Board, and more. Allow the youth to grow and learn, the Browns should not short them of reps or playing time.

<br>

### Final Verdict:

While I have no issue with Bryant, I do not see him and the Browns as a successful fit, Bryant has too much baggage and I believe the Browns should target a quieter veteran whom can mentor and help the young receiver room grow. Eli Rodgers makes a lot of sense to me, a quiter player who has previously played in Todd Haley's system and can be a viable player while still allowing the youth to develop. Bryant should receive another opportunity but not with the Cleveland Browns.
