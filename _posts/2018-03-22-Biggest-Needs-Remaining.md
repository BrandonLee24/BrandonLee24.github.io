As we near April, Coaches, front offices, scouts, and teams prepare for the 2018 NFL draft. With an influx of quarterbacks and top-tier talent, we dive into the Browns biggest remaining needs and possible fits.

##1) Quarterback

Yes, the Browns signed Tyrod Taylor, swapping a 3rd-round pick for the former Buffalo Bills gunslinger, but he only has a year remaining on his contract, and with numerous mistakes in the past, the Browns must take a quarterback with the first pick. This player can then develop and learn for a year behind Taylor and potentially be his successor.

###Option 1) Sam Darnold - Quarterback USC

###Option 2) Josh Allen - Quarterback Wyoming

###Option 3) Baker Mayfield - Quarterback Oklahoma

###Option 4) Josh Rosen - Quarterback UCLA

With the Jets recent trade up with the Colts to pick 3, the Browns must take a quarterback with their first pick if they wish to choose the player, if they wait till the 4th pick, it is very likely multiple quarterbacks will be off the board. Darnold has the intangibles and has impressed on and off the field, displaying not only talent, but composure and leadership. Allen is beloved by many scouts for his size and arm strenght, but suffers from consistency with his completion percentage, similarly to Deshone Kizer. Mayfield, the 2017 CFB Heisman Trophy winner, has incredible precision and accuracy, but is considered short for an NFL quarterback and has displayed some issues off the field. Lastly, Rosen, who was previously pegged to the Browns in multiple mock drafts, has fallen down the board due to lingering injuries and a lack of leadership and mental skills on the field. While he is extremely talented, teammates have stated they do not like him, and he has suffered from a throwing shoulder injury.

##2) Cornerback

Despite signing T.J. Carrie and Terrance Mitchell, the Browns are still lacking a playmaker in their secondary. If they are to pass on the likes of Saquan Barkley, Minkah Fitzpatrick, and Bradley Chubb with the 4th pick, the Browns may trade down and pursue a blue-chip cornerback. If they do select a player with the 4th pick, expect a corner to be headed to Cleveland at the beggining of the 2nd round.

###Option 1) Denzel Ward - Cornerback Ohio State

###Option 2) Josh Jackson - Cornerback Iowa

###Option 3) Jaire Alexander - Cornerback Louisville

###Option 4) Mike Hughes - Cornerback UCF

###Option 5) Isaiah Oliver - Cornerback Colorado

Denzel Ward, Josh Jackson, and Jaire Alexander all are likely to be off the board by the 33rd pick, with Hughes a possibility as well. For the Browns to aquire one of the top three players, they would have to trade down or trade back up into the first round. Ward displayed spectacular skills over his career at Ohio State, Josh Jackson then lit up the Buckeyes, and Jaire Alexander followed by impressing at the combine. At UCF, Mike Hughes was stout, and Isaiah Oliver could be a bit of a sleeper coming out of Colorado.

##3) Offensive Tackle

With the retirement of legend Joe Thomas, Shon Coleman will get the first opportunity at replacing the future hall of famer, but expect the Browns to target another tackle in the draft, likely early, to compete with Coleman and potentially even start.

###Option 1) Mike McGlinchey - Offensive Tackle Notre Damn
 
###Option 2) Connor Williams - Offensive Tackle Texas

###Option 3) Orlando Brown - Offensive Tackle Oklahoma

###Option 4) Kolton Miller - Offensive Tackle UCLA

Mike McGlinchey and guard Quenton Nelson are an immaculate duo coming out of Notre Damn and both could be immediate starters. Out of Texas, Connor Williams has solid tape and size and will likely follow McGlinchey and go in the first round. Despite a horrid NFL combine, Orlando Brown has incredible size and tape, telling scouts to watch film, not the combine. Laslty, Miller was the opposite of Brown, impressing all with his athleticism at the combine. Brown and Miller could see their names called in the first or second round, with at least one likely to be available for the Browns at the 33rd or 35th selection.
