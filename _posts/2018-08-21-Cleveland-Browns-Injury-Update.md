## Josh Gordon

The superstar receiver has yet to be cleared by the NFL to practice, but when he is available, Gordon must do a lot to make up the 2 weeks he missed. Gordon can and has attended meetings and done off the field work but is not yet available to contribute to the team.

## E.J. Gaines

The former Bills cornerback suffered a knee sprain and was carted off the field on Sunday, with the team later announcing he is expected to miss 3 weeks. Gaines had been practicing with the second team and has shown ability when healthy. Gaines was signed to a one year deal after a solid year with the Bills.

## Kevin Zeitler

The Browns starting right guard suffered a calf injury early in Browns camp and has only been able to watch since. The former Bengal seems close to a return but the Browns have no intention of rushing him and risking another injury. Spencer Drango has been starting in his place.

## Trevon Coley

Coley, a former undrafted free agent, earned a starting spot last season at defensive tackle and played well all season. A high ankle sprain sidelined him but he is working his way back and should return before the season starts. He is poised to command a starting spot for the 2nd year in a row on the Browns defensive front.

## Antonio Callaway

The 4th round pick this year has been banged up numerous times and currently is suffering from a minor groin injury. Considered minor, Callaway will be ready to go for the season and looks poised to play a major role in Todd Haley's offense.

## Ricardo Louis

The Browns leading receiver last season suffered a neck injury which required surgery this offseason, ending his year early. Louis played in every Browns game last season and will be focused on his recovery and preparing for next year.

## Howard Wilson

A 4th round choice in 2017, Wilson has suffered injuries early in camp both seasons as a Cleveland Brown, abtaining a patella tendon injury this year which required surgery. His second season missed in a row, Wilson is a long shot to have an impact as a Brown ever.
