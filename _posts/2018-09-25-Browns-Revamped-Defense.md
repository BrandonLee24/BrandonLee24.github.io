In Gregg Williams' second year, the Cleveland Browns' defense has been stellar, limiting the high powered offenses of the Steelers, Saints, and Jets to an average of 20 points. The team also has a +9 turnover ratio through three games, a major difference from last year. The additions made to the secondary as well as the other groups staying relatively healthy has led to the formation of one of the NFL's better defenses. Below we anaylze how each position group has faired so far.

### Defensive Line

This group is anchored by Myles Garrett and Larry Ogunjobi who have accounted for 7 out of the Browns' 9 sacks along with 2 forced fumbles. Emmanuel Ogbah suffered an early injury and has been sidelined since but Chris Smith has filled in admireably. The biggest disappointment of the group has been Trevon Coley, the second year player who only has 8 tackles so far. If the team improved the position and added another stud up front, the front four would have the potential to be deadly. The group also is lacking in depth, causing Garrett and Ogunjobi to be on the field for almost every defensive snap thus far.

### Linebackers

Joe Schobert has been flying around all season and leads the team in tackles with 23. He led the league last year and could be on pace to do so again. Jamie Collins has been average, not yet displaying the talent the Browns know he has but never doing anything bad. Captain Christian Kirksey only has 5 tackles this year due to injuries. Rookie Genard Avery has shined, notching a sack and a forced fumble along with 6 tackles. Lastly, James Burgess has remained a capable backup who replaced Kirksey before suffering an injury himself and playing well. Schobert leads this group but the players around him are talented as well and the depth at linebacker is stellar.

### Cornerbacks

A year after watching Jason McCourty and Jamar Taylor constantly get burned for big plays, Denzel Ward, Terrance Mitchell, and T.J. Carrie have been solid all year, shutting down opposing offenses. The rookie Ward leads the team with two interceptions and has forced a fumble as well. He has been disruptive and held receivers in check, shining against the Steelers and Jets. Terrance Mitchell has an interception and 2 forced fumbles, limiting receivers and disrupting the quarterback. After watching Briean Boddy-Calhoun get romped week 1, T.J. Carrie has been the slot guy and has not allowed much. The former Oakland Raider has a sack as well and consistently has made plays. Behind the top three, there is plenty of depth and capable players.

### Saftey

Rounding out the defense is the saftey position, where Damarious Randall, Jabrill Peppers, and Derrick Kindred have made big plays. The addition of Randall, a former cornerback with the Packers, has freed up Peppers and Kindred to play within the box and disrupt running plays. Randall himself has an interception, a phenomenal play in which he picked off Big Ben over his shoulder. Boddy-Calhoun adds depth here and all 4 safetys on the roster are talented.
