The Cleveland Browns just completed their second preseason game, losing to the Buffalo Bills 19-17. Today we will be discussing which Browns players have shined in these games and if this could be an indication of a major impact in the regular season. 

<br>

## New Offensive Additions

Tyrod Taylor, Carlos Hyde, and Jarvis Landry have shined throughout the offseason and the newcomers have reinvented the Browns culture. In week 1 of preseason, Taylor and Landry shined and displayed a connection that fans hope to see year long. Hyde was quiet against the Giants with just 1 carry but exploded against the Bills, totalling 9 carries for 64 yards and a touchdown. The passing game was inefficient against the Bills but the Browns know the talent Taylor and Landry possess and will be sure to utilize it all season. These three offensive weapons will be seen year long and will impact every Browns offensive snap in some fashion.

## Rashard Higgins

Last season, Higgins was cut at the end of the preseason, but this year he was determined to make the roster and may even see himself starting as he continues to shine. The former Colorado State product has 6 catches for 86 yards so far this preseason, but has displayed consitency which he lacked last season. The former 5th round selection has been a common target for both Tyrod Taylor and Baker Mayfield and will look to continue to expand his role in Todd Haley's offense.

## Myles Garrett

Surprised? You shouldn't be, Myles Garrett is a stud and always manages to standout. The 6'5" specimen is a generational talent, with a combination of speed and power that makes him virtually unstoppable. Out of Texas A&M, Garrett was a sure fire first overall pick and continues to show why on the field with the Browns. Through the first 2 preseason games, Garrett has 1 tackle and 1 quarterback hit but fans know how impactful he can be, he broke A.J. McCarron's collar bone and will wreak even more havok when the season begins.

## Larry Ogunjobi

Another young defensive lineman, after a quiet game versus the Giants, Ogunjobi exploded for 2 tackles for a loss and a sack against the Bills. The 24 year old is eyeing a starting position on the Browns defensive front but continues to work and tear up opposing offenses. A former third round pick, Ogunjobi flashed talent in 14 games last year but will see his role expand this season. His ability to rush the passer and take weight of Myles Garrett will be crucial, but he also regularly impacts the run game.

## "Backup" Linebackers

I put the work backup in quotations as one or more of these players could find themselves starting week one, but Mychal Kendricks, James Burgess, and Genard Avery have excelled in the first 2 preseason games. Kendricks has a sack and multiple quarterback hits, Burgess leads the team in tackles so far, and Avery was spotted flying around against the Bills. Arguably the best position group on the roster, Gregg Williams continues to rotate his linebackers and let the boys play. These three have consistently shown the ability to blow up plays and be impactful. Kendricks may end up starting, but all three will see the field in games and will shine.
