With a much improved starting lineup, the Browns offense expects major growth in Hue Jackson's third year as head coach, however John Dorsey has mad it a focus to aquire and build depth within the team, preaching the next man up concept. Below we examine a few of the Browns' backups whom seem set to be major contributors. The players examined below are playmakers, lineman and quarterbacks were not included in the list.

### Duke Johnson

Johnson led the team with 693 receiving yards last season and will continue to expand his role in the team this year. With his athleticism, The Duke is capable of running and catching out of the back field and lining out wide, a skill set coveted by many head coaches in todays game. The Browns were smart this offseason to sign the former Miami standout to a contract extension, ensuring his talents remain in Cleveland for years to come.

### Corey Coleman

Coleman, a first round pick in 2016, has a solid chance to start, but if he does not and is able to remain healty, the third year receiver could blossom into a talented third or fourth option. With Josh Gordon out currently, Coleman is eyeing a starting spot, and if he remains of the disabled list and shows growth, by all means he will be out there.

### Seth Devalve

A former receiver at Princeton, Devalve excells at route running from the tight end position. Racking up almost 400 yards last season, the 25 year old will continue to grow and should see valuable time behind David Njoku. Devalve is a smart player, enrolling at Princeton, with solid hands and will be a solid contributor this coming season.

### Nick Chubb

Rough and tough, Nick Chubb has stood out throughout camp and even may end up starting over Carlos Hyde. Chubb is second all-time in SEC rushing yards, pounding out 4769 in his career at Georgia. A downhill, power runner, Chubb has impressed with his old school approach, with media and coaches focusing and chattering about him constantly. If he does not earn the starting nod, Chubb will be on the field plenty and will be a major factor in Todd Haley's offense.

### Rashard Higgins

Rounding out the key offensive playmakers coming off the bench is Rashard Higgins, a player whom was cut by the Browns at the beginning of last season but earned his spot back and had 312 receiving yards. Higgins is only 23 and Browns coaches have been impressed, stating how he is determined to make the team this season. According to Hue Jackson, Higgins and Baker Mayfield has developed a strong connection and Higgins has lit up the second team defense on multiple occasions. If he continues to improve, Higgins will see the field in games and has shown the potential to be impactful.
