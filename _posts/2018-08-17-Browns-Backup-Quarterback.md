The Cleveland Browns have three capable quarterbacks for the first time in what feels like centuries. The group is headlined by Tyrod Taylor who John Dorsey traded a third round pick to aquire from Buffalo. Taylor has shined on and off the field, but as a mobile quarterback there remain injury risks and liabilities. We all know about Baker Mayfield, the teams first overall selection this year, but what about the veteran who was brought in, Drew Stanton.

<br>

The 33 year old Stanton has been in the for over 10 years after being a 2nd round selection by Detroit in 2007. The former Michigan State standout rarely found the field with the Lions, only ever seeing the field when the two quarterbacks ahead of him on the depth chart went down with injuries. From there he went to the Jets and Colts before landing with the Cardinals and sticking for a few years as Carson Palmer's backup. He remained with the Cardinals for 4 years before signing a 2 year contract with the Browns this offseason.

Stanton has had a small impact actually on the field, only starting 17 games in his career. While he has proven to be capable of running an offense and controlling a game, Stanton was not brought to Cleveland to do so, John Dorsey wanted him for his leadership and locker room presence. Stanton will mentor and help both Tyrod Taylor and Baker Mayfield and with his immense knowledge of the game, he could have a serious impact in their development and play this season. He could also help Todd Haley and Gregg Williams scheme against opposing teams as he has been in the league for so long.

As for who should be the Browns backup quarterback to Taylor, I give Stanton the nod. Mayfield has shown talent but as we saw with Deshone Kizer last season, there is no need to rush a rookie, especially with 2 proven quarterbacks on the roster. Stanton, at least at the start of the season, should be the Browns backup if anything was to happen to Tyrod Taylor, as he has NFL experience and has displayed the capability to win games. Mayfield, despite taking second team reps all offseason, should not be dissapointed by this and will most definitley continue to compete. The Browns simply should not rush another rookie quarterback.
