## Projected Defense

<br>

The Browns defense under Gregg Williams last season was much improved, but with players healthy again and a revamped secondary, the Cleveland Browns defense might surprise a few teams this year. Below we predict the 11 players whom will be on the field at the start of the season.

<br>

### Myles Garrett

Without a doubt, the most elecrifying Brown this defense has seen in years. Garrett, the former first overall pick, has incredible size and speed and will be a menace when on the field this season. In just 11 games during an injury riddled rookie season, Garrett posted 7 sacks, screaming past offensive lineman and often forcing double and even triple teams. With Ogbah healthy and Gregg Williams creative blitzes, Garrett will be a force to reckon with this year.

<br>

### Trevon Coley

A former undrafted free agent, Coley surprised many when he played his way into the Browns starting lineup last season. At just 24, Coley should continue to grow and will likely be more of a run stopper for this Browns' front. Out of Florida Atlantic, Coley will need to continue to display his skills, otherwise second year player Caleb Brantley could steal the starting spot.

<br>

### Larry Ogunjobi

Selected at the start of the third round last year, Ogunjobi quietly had a solid season, with 32 tackles in 14 games. Ogunjobi, like Coley, is just 24 and the youthful pair should improve together and form a tandem that can pressure and stop the run. Expect the second year player to impress this upcoming season, taking pressure off Myles Garrett and Emanuel Ogbah and impacting the run game.

<br>

### Emmanuel Ogbah

Selected with the 33rd pick in 2016, Ogbah has flashed immense talent, with 4 sacks in just 10 games last season before breaking his leg. Despite missing close to half the season, Ogbah invented himself as a talented run stopper and displayed skill at batting down passes, landing in the top 5 among defensive lineman without playing the whole season. With Garrett healthy on the other edge, these two will wreak havoc on opposing offenses for years to come.

<br>

### Jamie Collins

After being aquired from the Patriots via trade, Collins has struggled to remain on the field. Clearly, he is extremely talented, disrupting play after play when healthy, but a knee injury ended his season just 6 games in last year. If he is able to remain on the field, Collins will be a bright spot on this defense and will enable other players to make plays.

<br>

### Joe Schobert

The Browns lone probowler in 2017, Schobert led the league in tackles, topping out at 142. He did so while playing every snap, a feat he will not do this season with the aquisition of Mychal Kendrick. Commanding the middle of the Browns defense, the former Wisconsin stud is only 24 and has plenty of room to grow, which he must now do with the aquisition of Kendricks, a former super bowl winner.

<br>

### Christian Kirksey

In his 4 years in the league, all with the Browns, Kirksey has appeared in every game, playing every snap along with Schobert last season. Out of Iowa, Kirksey is a tackling machine, impacting almost every play. This year, however, he and Schobert must focus on pass defense, as tight ends and running backs carved the middle of the Browns defense last season. With Kendricks there to push players and reinforce competition, the Browns linebackers will be forced to focus and improve.

<br>

### Denzel Ward

The 4th overall pick this year, Ward has impressed throughout the offseason and has largely played with the first team defense. Out of Ohio State, the 21 year old plays press defense, enabling him to be isolated and command an island by himself. Ward will see the likes of Antonio Brown week one, an interesting and difficult start to one's NFL career.

<br>

### T.J. Carrie

Aquired after spending the last season in Oakland, Carrie is simply paid to start and I believe this will get him the nod. A viral video of him getting burned by Jarvis Landry did not help his case, but as long as he maintains focus and illustrates his abilities, Carrie will be paired with Ward and will look to improve the Browns secondary greatly. If Carrie falters though, Terrance Mitchell has impressed and could eye a starting spot.

<br>

### Damarious Randall

The Browns traded Deshone Kizer for Randall whom played cornerback with the Packers, but the former first round pick will return to his natural position at free saftey with Cleveland. Last year, Jabrill Peppers was forced to line up 20 yards down field to make up for the Browns weak cornerbacks, but the addition of Randall enables him to return to his natural position and the secondary to be more free to take risks. He also could help the Browns linebackers in coverage and will enable Peppers and Kindred to focus on the run.

### Jabrill Peppers

While he and Derrick Kindred are in a fierce battle in training camp, I give the former first round pick the starting nod based on athleticism and potential. Peppers played a plethora of positions in college and could be utilized in all those roles, moving around the box and giving opposing offenses different looks constantly. Peppers is a phenomenal run stopper and could cover tight ends with his size and speed, freeing up the linebackers to be more active.
