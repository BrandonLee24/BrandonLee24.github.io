The Cleveland Browns have agreed to trade offensive lineman Shon Coleman to teh San Francisco 49ers for a 2019 seventh-round pick.

The former Auburn standout was a third-round selection in the 2016 NFL draft, appearing in 23 games over 2 seasons with the team. Last year, Coleman started all 16 games at right tackle and had the first crack at the left tackle vacancy this year. After 1 week, Coleman dropped to the second team offense and was likely to be left off the team's 53 man roster.
