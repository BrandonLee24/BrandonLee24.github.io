### Damarious Randall and Desmond Harrison inactive vs Chiefs

<br>

The Browns will be facing one of the best offenses in the NFL without their starting saftey, Damarious Randall. The former Green Bay Packer has been dealing with an injury since the start of the season but will miss his first game in a Browns uniform against the Cheifs. Expect Briean Boddy-Calhoun to start in his place and E.J. Gaines to see a lot of action at cornerback.

The team will also be missing its starting left tackle, undrafted rookie Desmond Harrison, who delt with an illness this week and will be unable to go. Gregg Robinson looks set to start in his place and the front 5 will need to work out chemistry quickly. Freddie Kitchens will be calling plays in a professional game for the first time today and will have to adjust to the news.

The entire list of inactives is listed below. Rashard Higgins returns for the first time since week 5. Antonio Callaway was also listed as questionable but will suit up.
