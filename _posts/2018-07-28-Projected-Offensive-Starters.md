## Projected Offense

<br>

As the Browns are set to put on the pads today and truly get to work in training camp, I will be looking in at whom I believe fans will see starting on the field when the Browns face off versus the Steelers week 1.

<br>

### Tyrod Taylor

Traded for during the offseason, Taylor has been named the starter since day 1. After commanding the Bills to the playoffs last season, Taylor was aquired by the Browns whom hope to finally fill a spot that has troubled them for years. Taylor does not turn the ball over and is a very mobile quarterback, giving Todd Haley numerous options to play with.

<br>

### Carlos Hyde

The former Ohio State stud has 4 years of experience and coming off his best season in San Fransisco, expect Hyde to start at least initially. All three Cleveland backs will be on the field a lot, but Hyde is able to do it all; run, pass, and block, so I give him the starting nod here.

<br>

### Jarvis Landry

After leading the league in receptions last season, Landry headlines the Browns receiving corps with Josh Gordon. After an abysmal performance by the Browns receiver last year, the former Dolphin will improve the group heftily and has already impressed throughout camp.

<br>

### Josh Gordon

While away from the team right now, I believe in and expect Gordon to return to the Browns before the season starts. As seen in 5 games last year, Gordon is still himself, still an absolute animal on the field with concerns off, but I believe he is truly turning his life around and will be tearing up defenses this season.

<br>

### Antonio Callaway

That's right, the rookie from Florida who has no played in over a year, beats out former first round pick Corey Coleman for the 3rd starting receiving job. Callaway has shined in camp and expect him to only get better. He also has not had any off the field troubles, a good sign for a player with a murky past.

<br>

### David Njoku

Suma spikes will be a common occurance this year, David Njoku is blossuming into a star and will continue to grow. Despite being only 22, the former Miami tight end has proven he can hang with the big boys. Njoku will command the middle of the field and the redzone.

<br>

### Shon Coleman

While competition for the left tackle spot is fierce, Coleman leads the race currently and I expect to see him out there come week 1. He was a liability at right tackle last season but I see him out shining Austin Corbett, Desmond Harrison, and Greg Robinson and getting the starting nod.

<br>

### Joel Bitonio

The former Wisconsin lineman, Bitonio is not going anywhere. Last season he formed a solid bond with J.C. Tretter and Kevin Zeitler and the trio will return to the field again this season, bar injuries.

<br>

### J.C. Tretter 

A former Packer, Tretter was a solid piece last season and will retain his starting spot at center. With a year of chemistry with his guards, the interior lineman should shine this year and the run game will improve because of it.

<br>

### Kevin Zeitler

After signing a massive, 5 year contract, Zeitler was a firm starter and will only improve as he sees the field again. With a 81.1 grade last season, Zeitler is above average and should shine this year.

<br>

### Chris Hubbard

Rounding out the offense is the newly aquired right tackle. The former Steeler has started multiple games in the past and already knows offensive coordinator Todd Haley. Hubbard will slot right into a starting role and should command the right side after an up and down performance by Shon Coleman last season.
