## Running Back

<br>

### Starter: Carlos Hyde

Signed by the Browns in free agency, Hyde looks to take over and be the lead back this season. In San Fransisco, Hyde excelled in the shotgun formation, commonly used by the Browns last year, posting over 900 yards the past 2 seasons. The former Buckeye should see most of the 1st and 2nd down snaps and will be a workhorse for Cleveland. Behind a strong offensive line, Hyde should break 1,000 yards this year. He also has the ability to catch the ball out of the back field, a valuable asset in the NFL today.

#### Roster Chance: 95%

### Starter: Duke Johnson

Entering his 4th season, Johnson continues to develop in his role as a change of pass back whom has the ability to catch the ball and make plays out of the backfield. Last year, Johnson led the Browns in receptions, and with the new aquisition of Jarvis Landry and a full season with Josh Gordon, Duke should find himself open more often. When he catches the ball and has space, the former Miami product is hard to bring down, forcing missed tackles all across the field. With Hyde likely being the workhorse, Johnson will be used as a 3rd down and change of pace back who can also be split out wide.

#### Roster Chance: 99%

### Reserve: Matthew Dayes

Dayes, a 7th round selection in the 2017 draft, never saw the field much except for special teams. While he did average over 24 yards on kick return, Jabrill Peppers returned to that role when he was healthy, leaving Dayes scrambling for playing time. While he appeared to be a solid backup, if the Browns select a running back in this years draft, it is very unlikely Dayes will remain with the team, and if he does, it will be for special teams purposes.

#### Roster Chance: 20%

<br>

### Reserve: Kelvin Taylor

Signed by the Browns in January, Taylor finds himself on his 3rd team in just 2 years. The Florida product has never seen the field for a meaningful snap, but has potential at just the age of 24. The son of Fred Taylor, Kelvin was brought to compete in camp and it would be extremely suprising to see him make the team in 2018. 

#### Roster Chance: 5%

<br>

### Reserve: Darius Jackson

The speedy Jackson, who ran a 4.39 40 yard dash at his pro day at Eastern Michigan, has never received a snap at running back in his NFL career. Claimed by the Browns last season, Jackson spent the year on the IR. With his speed, Jackson could hope to earn a special teams slot but it is unlikely he will become anything more.

### Additional Aquisitions

With Carlos Hyde and Duke Johnson, the Browns have a formidable duo in the backfield but they could look to add a rookie into the mix whom would compete with Dayes for the final running back spot and potentially a special teams spot. While may have predicted the Browns will take Saquon Barkley, I expect the Browns to look for a second round running back, or trade back into the third round and look for a sleeper. John Dorsey selected Kareem Hunt in the 3rd round last year and could look to find another Jem again this season.

### Postion Grade: B+

Hyde is a strong back whom can take a lot of carries and should excell in the Browns scheme. Newly hired offensive coordinator Todd Haley did wonders with Le'veon Bell and should help Hyde and the Browns run game. Duke Johnson will continue to play the roll of a pass catcher and change of pace back, especially on 3rd downs, and can be used as a slot receiver as well. With both of these players and likely another rookie, Haley should make this backfield a strength of the Browns, taking some pressure off Tyrod Taylor.
