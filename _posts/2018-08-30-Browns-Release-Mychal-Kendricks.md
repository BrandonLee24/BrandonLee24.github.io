The former Philadelphia Eagles linebacker and super bowl winner has been release by the Cleveland Browns following the news that he had partook in insider trading. The linebacker had signed a 1 year, 2.25 million dollar with the team this offseason.

Kendricks admitted to the charges, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of securities fraud, per U.S. Attorney William McSwain. Kendricks likely will face prision time if convicted, with a maximum sentence of 25-years, a three-year period of supervised release, and a $5,250,000 fine in addition to forfeiture of the money made from the offenses.

Browns general manager John Dorsey released this statement: "Prior to signing Mychal, we were informed that there was a financial situation that he had been involved with in 2014. We were told Mychal had fully cooperated with investigators as a victim. From what was communicated at that time and based on the numerous questions we asked and further due diligence on our part, including checking with the league office, there was no information discovered that conveyed otherwise.

"Recently, we were provided an update on the matter and the circumstances have changed. We are now dealing with a different set of facts and the additional information we've gathered has led us to the decision to release Mychal from our team. Due to the ongoing legal nature of this situation, we will have no further comments."

The release of Kendricks could guarentee a spot for James Burgess and could open another one for Justin Currie, B.J. Bello, or others.
