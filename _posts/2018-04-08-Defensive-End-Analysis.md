## Defensive End

<br>

### Starter: Myles Garrett

The first overall draft pick in 2017, Garrett performed up to his expectations when healthy. The only problem with that sentence is the word "when" illustrating how Garrett missed multiple games, but when on the field he excelled. In 11 games, Garrett totaled 7 sacks, 31 tackles, and forced a fumble as well. The Texas A&M product will progress and will have double digit sacks if he remains healthy and does not get triple-teamed this season. Garrett will be a force to reckon with for years to come and when paired with Emanuel Ogbah, the Browns front line was exciting.

#### Roster Chance: 100%

<br>

### Starter: Emanuel Ogbah

Emanuel Ogbah, drafted with the first pick of the second round 2 years ago, started 10 games this year before he broke his leg, totaling 29 tackles and 4 sacks, along with 2 forced fumbles. When lined up next to Garrett, the two appeared to be unstopable, teams were forced to keep running backs in the backfield, as if they didn't, their quarterback was meeting the turf. If Ogbah can stay healthy, he should continue to develop and play a vital role in the Browns defense for years to come.

#### Roster Chance: 99%

### Backup: Carl Nassib

The 6'7" defensive end out of Penn State has never truly proven himself on the field, despite putting up spectacular numbers in college, the third round pick has not developed as the Browns had hoped, ammassing a measly 5.5 sacks over 2 seasons. Nassib also had numerous idiotic penalties last year, but expect him to grow in his third year and see a role as a backup pass rusher. If he can develop and limit penalties, Nassib could see a larger role and form a sort of trio with the two starters.

#### Roster Chance: 80%

<br>

### Backup: Chris Smith

Signed in March, Smith has been a career backup, never starting a game over 4 seasons. Last year, Smith played in all 16 games for the Bengals, ammassing 26 tackles and 3 sacks. For the Browns, Smith will hope to continue this role and will see time when Garrett and/or Ogbah are off the field. 

#### Roster Chance: 60%

<br>

### Reserve: Nate Orchard

Selected in the 2nd round of the 2016 draft, Orchard was expected to become a regular along the Browns defensive front. During his rookie campaign, Orchard had 36 tacles and 3 sacks, along with an interception and a forced fumble, solid stats for a rookie. The next season however, Orchard only played in 3 games before landing on the IR and he has never been the same since, lacking any sight of burst last season. Orchard will be battling Nassib and Smith for the backup spots along the defensive line, and if the Browns select another lineman, the former second round pick could be cut.

#### Roster Chance: 40%

### Additional Aquisitions

Despite having a solid, young nucleus, the Browns are potentially in position to draft Bradley Chubb with their 4th overall pick. The group could use another playmaker, whether Chubb or a later selection, to fill in if anyone suffers an injury and provide depth. The Browns will likely carry 9-10 defensive lineman during the season, so expect the defensive ends to be competitive spots, especially if more young talent is infused.

### Position Grade: A-

With the phenome Myles Garrett and the run-stopping Emanuel Ogbah, the Browns defensive front looks to be loaded for years to come. If the two are able to stay healthy they should carve offensive lines for a long time. If another solid player is brough in and Nassib and Smith are able to develop and improve, this group could be deep and extremely strong. Paired with Coley, Ogunjobi, and Brantley, the Browns have an intriguing, youthful front 4, which should excell in stopping the run. If Chubb or another playmaker is brought in or the backups improve, three defensive ends could be seen on third down packages, ensuring that the quarterback is pressered and fazed.
