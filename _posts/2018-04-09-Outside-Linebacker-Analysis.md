## Outside Linebacker

<br>

### Starter: Jamie Collins

After trading for him in 2016 from New England, Collins has been a phenome when on the field, but unfortunatley spent more time off the field then on last year, never allowing the Browns to truly display their full-strength defense. Despite playing just 6 games last year, Collins had 31 tackles a forced fumble, and an interception which unfortunatley led to his injury on the return. If Collins is able to return to full strength, he will return to starting and should help the Browns linebackers in coverage, something which they struggled with all last season.

#### Roster Chance: 99%

### Starter: Christian Kirksey

"Kirko", the Browns middle linebacker in 2016, was drafted in the third round in 2014 and has impressed ever since, earning a 4 year, 38 million dollar contract last season. The former Iowa linebacker, Kirksey was second on the team in 2017 with 138 tackles, 10 less than his 148 the previous season. The 5th year pro also has ammassed 11.5 sacks over his career, with 3.5 coming from last year, along with 2 forced fumbles. At just the age of 25, Kirksey should be a starter for the Browns at linebacker for years to come, especially if he can maintain his incredible tackling numbers. 

#### Roster Chance: 100%

### Backup: James Burgess

Burgess, an undrafted free agent who landed with the Browns after playing on 4 other teams, filled in for the injured Collins and exceeded expectations, totaling 75 tackles and 4 sacks in 9 starts. Returning for a third year on the Browns roster, Burgess fits in as a solid backup who can fill in in a heartbeat without displaying much of a dropoff. At just 24, Burgess should be a shoe-in to make the roster and if Collins does not display the same ability he did before his injury, Burgess could compete for more playing time.

#### Roster Chance: 90%

### Backup: Dominique Alexander

Claimed by the Browns in 2016 after going undrafted, Alexander displayed some ability and saw time in 4 games before landing on the injured reserve. Alexander is a solid special teams player who should maintain his spot on the roster if he is able to continue to showcase his ability to grind and do the dirty work. He can also fill in as needed at linebacker, and while not as talented as the starters, is still a solid option.

#### Roster Chance: 50%

### Additional Aquisitions

The Browns have talent at outside linebacker, as well as some depth, but could use a linebacker who excells in coverage. Having Collins back for a full season should help, but last year tight ends and running backs carved up the Browns, and while they were able to tackle, they were unable to slow offenses down. Expect them to target a 2nd or 3rd day draft pick whom can learn from Collins and Kirksey and help with coverage.

### Position Grade: B+

While the positions is relatively deep, they lack a true coverage linebacker and still have questions as to whether Collins and Alexander can return to full health and potential. The outside linebacker corps is one of the Browns strongest positions but still has room for improvement.
