John Dorsey, general manager for The Cleveland Browns, knows that in the NFL, sometimes you have to cut your loses, accept you made a mistake on a player and just wave them goodbye. Despite an abysmal season with a plethora of drops and errors, Sashi Brown did not cut Kenny Britt, but when John Dorsey is hired, Britt is removed from the team immediatley. In the NFL, when a player is not performing and is being overpaid, do not allow them to leach, cut ties with the player. Britt was no help to the team or the development of the younger players, he simply signed for the money with no interest in playing. While not all players are like this, the Browns must learn from this, learn not only to be cautious with signings but to not be afraid to cut their losses and move on.
