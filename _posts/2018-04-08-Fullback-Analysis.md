## Fullback

<br>

### Starter: Dan Vitale

The former Northwestern "superback" was signed by the Browns in 2016 and has held onto his role since. Vitale played in 15 games last season, starting 6, and performed well in his role as a lead blocker. While only 24, it will be interesting to see if Todd Haley will use a fullback, and if Vitale reminds Haley of Roosevelt Nix, he should be able to find a roster spot. Vitale also played on special teams for the Browns last season.

### Reserve: Marquez Williams

Entering his second season out of Miami, Williams will battle Vitale and any other fullback the Browns sign or draft for a spot in 2018. Last season, Williams was signed in December and played in 1 game when Vitale was injured, but if he is hoping to make the roster, Williams must display skill on special teams.

### Additional Aquisitions

Look for the Browns to sign or possibly even draft a fullback late, one who will compete in camp and may be more of the mold which Todd Haley likes. It is also possible the Browns do not keep a fullback on the roster as well, so any potential Browns fullback will likely need to be a solid special teams player as well.

### Position Grade: C+

While Vitale is a solid NFL fullback, he is nothing special and may not be used at all with Carlos Hyde and Duke Johnson. If the Browns continue to use the shotgun formation, fullback becomes less of a need, if one at all. The Browns may sign a fullback who competes and earns a spot as well, but if one is to make the roster, it will most likely be because of special teams reasons.
