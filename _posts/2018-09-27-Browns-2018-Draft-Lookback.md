Today we are looking back at the Browns 2018 draft class and the impact each player has made. With the first and fourth overall selections, the Browns had the ability to add some big time playmakers to the team.

<br>

## 1st Overall - Baker Mayfield (QB)

<br>

The former heisman winner has only played a little more than 1 half of football so far this season but excelled in that game, leading a comeback against the Jets to capture the teams first win since 2016 and take over as the teams starting quarterback. Mayfield was 17 of 23 for 201 yards and displayed his pocket presence, strong arm, and accuracy which fans were hoping to see. He appears set to start and command the Browns offense for the future and dispite such a small sample size, Mayfield has looked like the best rookie quarterback thus far.

<br>

## 4th Overall - Denzel Ward (DB)

<br>

Following the path of former Ohio State Cornerback Marshon Lattimore, Ward has lit up the league in his first three games, commanding the top cornerback spot and notching 2 interceptions and a forced fumble. He shut down Antonio Brown and followed a tough week two versus Mike Thomas with a strong showing agianst the Jets, allowing just 8 total yards. Ward has been flying across the field and constantly disrupts plays, leading fans to believe the selection of him over Bradley Chubb was wise.

<br>

## 33rd Overall - Austin Corbett (OL)

<br>

Corbett began the season attempting to become the teams next left tackle but quickly was moved inside and has played guard since. He seemed set to start at left guard until Hue Jackson decided the offensive line was better with undrafted free agent Desmond Harrison at left tackle and Joel Bitonio returning inside to guard. Corbett was inactive week 1 but has seen the field for a few snaps when the Browns are in goal line situations the past 2 weeks. It appears that Corbett will add depth at guard and center this year and the team hopes he develops and improves with time.

<br>

## 35th Overall - Nick Chubb (RB)

<br>

Chubb's partner, Sony Michel, went a few picks before him, but the Browns were high on the power back and his old style of running. Chubb has only 7 carries on the season, but he has capitalized on those for a 5.9 ypc average. Chubb is still adjusting to professional football and needs to improve on his blocking and passing game presence. He has missed multiple blocks both in the backfield and on special teams, allowing a blocked punt last week versus the Jets. As the season progresses, expect to see more Chubb and his hardnosed running style.

<br>

## 67th Overall - Chad Thomas (DE)

<br>

The rookie out of Miami has yet to record a tackle and has had little presence on the field. The Browns have given him very few snaps and with the return of Emmanuel Ogbah this week, there will likely be even less for him. Thomas has great size and speed but is still a raw prospect who will need time to develop. If an injury occurs, Thomas could take on a larger role, but with the stud Myles Garrett playing almost every snap, Thomas is simply not needed yet and can continue to learn.

<br>

## 105th - Antonio Callaway (WR)

<br>

The Browns traded up in the fourth round to select the troubled receiver, but in 3 games he has emerged as a real deep threat, totaling 101 yards and a touchdown on 7 receptions. With Mayfield now starting, expect the Browns to target Callway down field and utilize his incredible speed. As long as he stays out of trouble, Callway will be an impact player in the NFL with the ability to break free at any moment. He is a perfect compliment to Jarvis Laundry and this draft pick looks better and better each day.

<br>

## 150th - Genard Avery (LB)

<br>

When selected in the 5th round, few had ever heard of the former Memphis linebacker, but his name is known to Browns fans and opposing defenses now.
