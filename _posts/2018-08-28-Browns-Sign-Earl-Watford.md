The Cleveland Browns have sign veteran guard Earl Watford, a former 4th round pick by the Arizona Cardinals that was recently cut by the Chicago Bears. The 6 foot 3, 300-pound lineman has previous experience at both guard spots, appearing in 42 games in his career. The 28 year old provides much needed depth at the interior line positions as Kevin Zeitler has been hampered by injury and Spencer Drango has faltered in his absence. Austin Corbett will remain the teams other starting guard as Watford's signing is simply for depth.

The Browns also announced Tuesday that they released receiver Evan Berry, offensive linemen Kevin Bowen and Geoff Gray, defensive lineman Marcell Frazier, and kicker Ross Martin. The team also released Julian Allen from injured reserve.

The release of Ross Martin ensures that Zane Gonzalez has won the kicking job and will be booming kicks when the Browns play the Steelers week 1. The other players released were no surprise and team may look to add other teams scraps to add depth where needed.
