As the trade deadline appraches, the Browns may look to address needs at a few positions and trade for additional players. Below we analyze what positions the Browns need to address and players they could realistically trade for.

<br>

## Wide Receiver

<br>

The Browns began the season with high hopes for the position but the release of Corey Coleman and trade of Josh Gordon left the group thin. Add on injuries to multipe players, the wide receiver position is the biggest need on the team currently. The return of Rashard Higgins soon will help greatly but the Browns could look to trade some late round draft picks for a player who has fallen out of favor with another team.

-Devonte Parker

-Demariyus Thomas

-Golden Tate

-Pierre Garcon

<br>

The most likely of these players to be traded is Parker, the Miami receiver whom has recently fallen out of favor with head coach Adam Gase. The Browns could aquire him for a later round draft pick and pair him with his former teammate Jarvis Landry. Golden Tate could become available due to his contract and the fact that Kenny Golladay and Marvin Jones has excelled. Thomas is unlikely to be traded and Garcon would only be aquired if the team truly believed it could compete this year.

## Linebacker/Pass Rusher

<br>

Another position which has suffered injuries, the Browns may not want to be starting rookie 5th rounder Genard Avery already and could add depth to this group. Also, teams can never have enough pass rushers and a 3rd down edge rusher could greatly help the team and allow Gregg Williams to deploy multiple packages.

-Shane Ray

-Shaquil Barrett

-Hassan Reddick

-Dante Fowler Jr.

<br>

The first 3 are the most likely to be dealt with their teams underachieving and at a minimum they would add depth. Ray and Barrett have had solid careers and could replace Jamie Collins as a starter if he continues to falter. Reddick was a former first round pick who has yet to live up to expectations and the Cardinals may look to cut their losses. Fowler was a former top-5 pick and has a proven record as a solid pass rusher. If any is to be aquired, expect it to be one of the Broncos linebackers.

<br>

## Quarterback

<br>

No, the Browns do not need to aquire a new quarterback, instead they should look to trade Tyrod Taylor. The former Bills quarterback led that team to the playoffs last year and is known for holding onto the ball, not forcing turnovers. Contending teams with lacking quarterbacks could look to add Taylor and bolster their quarterback room, while veteran Drew Stanton could replace Taylor as the Browns backup.

-Jacksonville Jaguars

-Miami Dolphins

<br>

The Jags are by far the most likely team Taylor would go to as Blake Bortles has been abysmal. They could rely on Taylors running ability and lack of turnovers and simply use thier running game and defense to win games. The Dolphins currently are riding with Brock Osweiler with Ryan Tannehill down with an injury but if they do not trust the former Browns quarterback, they could look to add some insurance.

<br>

## Cornerback

<br>

The Browns drafted Denzel Ward and brought in another 3 cornerbacks this offseason but injuries have thinned the room. While an addition is not neccessary with E.J. Gaines likely to return soon and Terrance Mitchell fighting for a comeback at the end of the year, the Browns may look to add more depth and promise with the group. If at the right price, a young corner may be sought after to pair with Ward.

-Gareon Conley

-Patrick Peterson

-Richard Sherman

-Janoris Jenkins

<br>

The Browns would be most inclined to trade for Conley, a former first round pick who has seen his snap count decrease with Jon Gruden's arrival. The other three options would only be made if the Browns believed they were contenting this year and were willing to depart with numerous assets to add another cornerback. Conley is the only one I see happening and still may be too costly for John Dorsey.
