## Baker Mayfield Announced as Browns' Starting QB

<br>

After just 3 weeks, the former first overall pick has been announced as the teams starting quarterback, moving veteran Tyrod Taylor to the bench. Mayfield entered Thursdays game versus the Jets at the end of the first half and mounted a 14 point comeback that ended in the Browns first win in 635 days. Mayfield was 17-23 for 201 yards and gave the fans a show they had been waiting to see.

Not only did Mayfield shine, but he elevated players around him and brought a whole new energy to the game, displaying his confident approach immediatley and inspiring the team. The Jets were forced to back out of the box and defend the pass, opening up the running game and Todd Haley's offense, something which Tyrod Taylor was uncapable of doing. Mayfield also was decisive, getting the ball out of his hands quick and fitting it into tight windows.

The future of the Browns is here, a new energy has suffocated the team and its fans. Let the Bake-Train roll Hue, Mr. Mayfield has his wits about him and the composure to be a phenomenal NFL quarterback... thankfully he will be doing that with the Cleveland Browns.
