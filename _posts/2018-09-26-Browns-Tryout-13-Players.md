This week, the Cleveland Browns tried out 13 players and while only 1, Pharaoh Brown, has been given a contract so far (practice squad), it is a sign that John Dorsey is constantly looking to improve this team and build the best franchise possible. Even if no one is added, it tells the team that no player is safe and hard work is necessary to remain on the team. The Browns won their first game in 635 days last week yet Dorsey doesn't settle and continues to work and yearn for the next win.

Pharoah Brown is a 6'6 tight end out of Oregon officially in his first NFL season. He was signed to the practice squad and Pharoah Cooper was released. Brown was with the Oakland Raiders this past offseason and could help the Browns gameplan for them this week.

Of the other players whom attended the tryout, the majority of them were defensive lineman, linebackers, and cornerbacks. This shows that Dorsey is still searching for depth and attempting to help the team in any way possible. The defensive line especially seems to be a group Dorsey is set on improving and if a trade occured no one would be surprised.

Multiple former Cleveland Browns were worked out by other teams this week as well, a sign that the team has improved and the talent that they did not decide to keep may be good enough to make other teams... the Browns have players other teams want!!!
