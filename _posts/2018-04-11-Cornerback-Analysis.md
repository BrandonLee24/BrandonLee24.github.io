## Cornerback

<br>

### Starter: Travis Carrie

Signed by the Browns from Oakland, the speedy Carrie looks set to start in the secondary for Cleveland, a spot which has been a real weakness of the team in recent years. With the departure of McCourty, Carrie remains a favorite to be the #1 corner for the Browns, and if the 27 year old is able to display enough to the Browns coaches, he will earn the spot. The former 7th round pick from Ohio University, Carrie has the speed and skills to be a solid starting cornerback.  

#### Roster Chance: 90%

### Starter: E.J. Gaines

Signed by the Browns in March, Gaines was impressive in Buffalo, with 9 passes defended, 3 forced fumbles, and an interception in just 11 games. Despite being 5'10", I expect Gaines to display his skills to the Browns and earn himself a starting role in a competitive position. Gaines has struggled to stay on the field the past 2 years, missing 5 games each, but has been an effective player when in the lineup. With so many men vying for few spots, Gaines must work and improve this offseason if he wants to play a prominent role for the Browns.

#### Roster Chance: 85%

### Starter: Briean Boddy-Calhoun

Despite all the additions and newcomers, Boddy-Calhoun has been in the system for 2 years and has displayed an incredible work ethic and determination when on the field. Also able to help on special teams, BBC will look to outwork the rest of the men and earn himself the nod to start, as he did in 7 games last season. Entering his second year under defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, Boddy-Calhoun will be pressed to impress.

#### Roster Chance: 80%

<br>

### Backup: Terrance Mitchell

Landing on his 6th team in 4 years, Mitchell looks to finally stick and play a prominent role on a team. The former Oregon player, 25 year old Mitchell started 9 and played in 15 games last season with the Chiefs, racking up 4 interceptions and 18 passes defended. Following this breakout season, Mitchell was signed as a free agent by the Browns and will look to find a starting job, but with a crowded space, he may end up being the 4th or even 5th guy on the depth charts, especially if Howard Wilson shows out or the Browns draft another rookie.

#### Roster Chance: 80%

<br>

### Backup: Jamar Taylor

After trading with the Dolphins in 2016, the Browns aquired Taylor who looked like a second round bust, but in his 2 seasons with Cleveland, Taylor has started every game but 3. Taylor has been a solid piece on the defense but never showed enough to remove worry from the Browns front office, leading to them aquiring numerous cornerbacks this offseason. Taylor will still contend for a starting role, but has never shown enough for the Browns to be confident in him and he could find himself traded or playing as a backup if he is not able to win the competition. 

#### Roster Chance: 70%

### Reserve: Michael Jordan

An undrafted free agent out of Missouri Western, Jordan was claimed by the Browns after being waived by the Rams. With injuries plaguing the Browns secondary, Jordan saw time in 15 games, filling in adequatley as a backup. Unfortunatley, with all the new players flooding the roster, Jordan will be lucky to make the roster, especially if additional players are aquired.

#### Roster Chance: 20%

<br>

### Reserve: Howard Wilson

Selected by the Browns in the 4th round last year, Wilson landed on the injured reserve before most players could even put on their cleats. The former Houston standout spent the entire season there and will have some catching up to do if he wants to be on the Browns active roster. As John Dorsey did not select him, he will have no problem cutting him, so Wilson must have a strong camp and show some talent if he wants to stick around. 

#### Roster Chance: 50%

<br>

### Reserve: Reginald Porter

Landing on his 3rd team last year, Porter was signed by the Browns from the Ravens practice squad in September and stayed with the team before falling onto the IR in November. Porter is only 23 years old and could sneak onto the roster due to his youth, but he remains an unlikely canidate to begin 2018 on the Browns active roster.

#### Roster Chance: 10%

<br>

### Reserve: Denzel Rice

Signed as a free agent in January, Rice has too many players to beat out for someone whom has never started a game or recorded an interception and will almost definitley be a roster casualty.

#### Roster Chance: 5%

<br>

### Reserve: Corey White

The Browns will be the 7th team for White and already at the age of 27, he will need to outwork the rest of the player. White played in 15 games, starting 4, for the Bills last season, and had 2 interceptions, but at a crowded spot for the Browns, White remains an outcast at making the roster, at best hoping for a backup spot.

#### Roster Chance: 30%

<br>

### Reserve: C.J. Smith

C.J. Smith will not make the Browns roster, they attempted to trade him for a 2019 7th round conditional pick (nothing) and he couldn't even pass the physical.

#### Roster Chance: 0%

<br>

### Additional Aquisitions

The Browns have added multiple talented players, but none are truly proven starters and the team could still look to add a true number one in the draft with one of their first 5 picks. If the added players compete and improve the position, the Browns secondary could see vast improvement and an increase in speed. Fans will be happy to no longer see receivers walk into the end zone freely against the Browns.

### Position Grade: B-

While the new aquistions will increase competition and improve the position, the Browns still lack a true #1 and have uncertanties behind that. The position is deep but not necessarily the strongest. The Browns cornerbacks will also enjoy better free saftey play and having both safties within 100 yards of every play, unlike last season when Jabrill Peppers often watched from the stands. Adding a lockdown coverage corner could push this position over the edge and make it a strength of the Browns for the first time since Joe Haden was in his prime.
