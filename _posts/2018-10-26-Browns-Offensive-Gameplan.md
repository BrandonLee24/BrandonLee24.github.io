The Cleveland Browns are getting set to face off versus the Pittsburg Steelers Sunday, the second matchup between the teams this year. Their first meeting, week 1, ended in a tie. As the team wraps up practice today, we discuss how the offense should utilize its playmakers and attack the Steelers defense.

## RPO's

<br>

Run pass options, plays which enable Baker Mayfield to make quick decisions and force the defense into a pickle, should be utilized more and have not been seen since the Oakland Raiders game in week 4. David Njoku, Jarvis Landry, and Duke Johnson should all be deployed on these plays, offering 3 viable options for Mayfield to get the ball too but also enabling them to make plays in space. With T.J. Watt rushing off the edge, Mayfield will need to make quick decisions. In week 1, the Steelers racked up 7 sacks, tourmenting the Browns offensie line, so implementing RPO's would force them to make decisions and diminish their pass rush.

## Quick Throws and Screens

<br>

With Jarvis Landry and Duke Johnson split outside, Todd Haley should emphasize getting the ball out to them quick. In space, they both are two of the most dangerous runners in the league. These quick outs often gain upwards of 5 yards and the Steelers secondary lacks the quickness to react and stuff these throws. They also can set up fakes later in the game and the team can attempt to burn the Steelers.

## Burn them Deep

<br>

Speaking of burning deep, the Browns should do just that. By enforcing the run and getting the ball out quick early, Antonio Callaway should be set up to dissect the Steelers secondary and slip behind the back lines. Breshard Perriman is also a speedy receiver whom could force the safties to make decisions and lead to big games for the team. The Browns front struggled with the Steelers week 1 and Mayfield must know he won't have a lot of time to make decisions, but if the Browns can hold T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward, and the Steelers front for a few seconds, Callaway and Perriman could expose the Steelers secondary.

## Duke Johnson

<br>

The former Miami standout's role in the offense has grown as the season has progressed, particularly with the trade of Carlos Hyde, but he could still get more touches. As a runner, Johnson is savvy and makes quick cuts, always capable of a 20+ yard gain, but his true skills are shown when he partakes in screens and is split out wide. Johnson can work in the slot and out wide, creating mismatches across the field. Running underneath routes, Mayfield can quickly get Johnson the ball and allow him to work in space. Todd Haley needs to utilize The Duke and get him the ball as much as possible.
