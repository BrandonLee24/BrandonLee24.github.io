As the Browns continue to prepare for their first preseason game this year, we take a look at what fans and coaches should look for and pay attention to.

<br>

## New Offense

The Browns offense has been completely remodeled, the quarterback room was cleansed, an offensive coordiator was finally brought in, and a talented receiver was aquired. While they may only play a quarter or 2, Browns fans and coaches should key in on Tyrod Taylor and Jarvis Landry and the chemistry they have already built. They should also note the offesive schemes used as Todd Haley, a former Steeler's coach, takes command of the offense. If all goes as planned, the Browns will show they have changed and that the offense is capable of scoring points and refraining from turning the ball over.

## Youthful Defense

The Browns defense is full of life, with talent spread out throughout, but it will be interesting to see how much young talents such as Myles Garrett, Larry Ogunjobi, Denzel Ward, and Jabrill Peppers have developed. The defense has the talent to suceed and with an overhaul of the secondary this group should be much improved. In Gregg Williams' second year, it will be interesting to watch how it all unfolds.

## Starters

While it's only the preseason, it is always fun to see who is starting and how position battles have gone so far. John Dorsey brought so much talent into Cleveland that there is a battle at almost every position and there are no locks. Players are fighting to start while other simply battle to see the field. With so much competition, it will be fun to watch.

## The Rookies

The Browns added numerous rookies this offseason in the draft and it is always interesting to see how they have developed and whom appears keen to play a role in the team. Baker Mayfield headlines the class and all eyes will be on the former Oklahoma quarterback when he reaches the field. Denzel Ward will start and will likely matchup against Odell, a tough challenge for a rookie. Nick Chubb, Austin Corbett, and Antonio Callaway will attempt to display their own talents when given a chance as well.
