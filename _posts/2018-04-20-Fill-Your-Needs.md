## Take the best player

<br>

Browns general manager, John Dorsey, has continuously stated how he believes in the principle of taking the best player available in the draft, and while there are instances in which this technique should be used, this principle is not always the best.

<br>

### The 4th Pick

<br>

With the 4th overall selection in the 2018 NFL draft, the Browns are expected to choose between Bradley Chubb and Saquon Barkley, and while both players are extremely talented at their repected positions, the Browns already have youth and talent at defensive end and running back. Instead of overloading one position, which can create turmoil on who deserves the majority of snaps, the Browns should focus on positions they need more help at, such as left tackle. Yes Bradley Chubb or Saquon Barkley should become superstars, but what does it matter if the Browns already have 2 talented players or more at each position. With Joe Thomas's retirement, Cleveland needs to find a new left tackle, and while none should be drafted as high as pick 4, the Browns should look to trade back, gather more picks, and find their future starting left tackle, one of the most important positions in the game. With early picks, the Browns must capitalize and find perrenial starters who will see th field and impact the game, especially at the most important positions.

### Later Selections

<br>

Later in the draft is when the best available player principle should be used, instead of taking someone who has a slight chance to develop into a backup at a position of need, the Browns should target players who have potential later in the draft no matter what position they play. The players selected late in the draft are unlikely to fil holes, so if you desperately need to improve a position, target it early in the draft and then find the best players at the end of the game.
