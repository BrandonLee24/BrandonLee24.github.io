Following the Browns scrimmage, we take a look back at how some of the key position battles have unfolded so far and predict who will be starting when week 1 begins.

## Running Back

When brought into Cleveland, it appeared clear that 4 year vetran Carlos Hyde would start, but with the selection of Nick Chubb, the position next to Tyrod Taylor is up for grabs. Chubb's name has been heard throughout camp as his old style of running has caught the attention of the coaches. He is second all time in SEC rushing yards and may look to climb his way onto the Browns' leaderboards as well. Hyde, a former San Francisco 49er, has shown the ability to handle double digit handles every week along with the ability to catch passes and be a threat out of the backfield. Rounding out the position group is Duke Johnson, a player who led the Browns in receiving last season and earned a hefty contract extension this offseason. While he figures to be a third down weapon, his ability to go outside and lineup at receiver will create numerous mismatches and when he reaches open space, it's almost impossible to bring him down.

#### Prediction

While Chubb has impressed and will see plenty of playing time, Hyde is a proven player whom has the upper hand at catching passes out of the backfield. Johnson may join one of Chubb or Hyde as a starter as well with his versatility.

## Left Tackle

Who would replace Joe Thomas has been a question of great debate ever since his retirement, but recently the Browns decided to slide 4 year starter Joel Bitonio outside to hopefully shore up the spot. Shon Coleman simply wasn't showing enough and no other Brown stepped up, so the coaching staff was forced to play there hand and move one of the NFL's best interior lineman outside. Bitonio was reluctant initially but thankfully this move comes early in camp and lining up against Myles Garrett will help Bitonio adjust and learn quickly. The former Nevada standout has past experience outside but never in the pros.

#### Prediction

Unless another piece is aquired this offseason, Bitonio will be the Browns left tackle for the forseeable future.

## Cornerback

When selected 4th overall, Denzel Ward was poised to be a shut down corner capable of playing on an island, and he has been just that, earning a spot with the first team defense early in camp and never looking back. Opposite the former Ohio State Buckeye there has been a fierce competition however, with former Raider T.J. Carrie and former Chief Terrance Mitchell largely going head to head pushing one another as hard as they can. Mitchell's name has been heard numerous times as he continues to excell and impress the coaches, hoping to build off a breakout season last year. Carrie was a starter and hopes to continue being so with the Browns. E.J. Gaines is another name who is not out of the competition either, as he has prior experience as a starter with the Bills. All 3 are capable of starting but there will likely be only 2 whom get the nod.

#### Prediction

Ward appears set to start and be the Browns lead corner, but despite Carrie's hefty contract, I expect to see Terrance Mitchell opposite Ward as he has excelled in camp and forces turnovers and big plays. Carrie, however, will see the field plenty and will be the starting slot corner.

## Strong Saftey

After playing together last season, Jabrill Peppers and Derrick Kindred now find themselves battling for 1 starting spot. Kindred is a run stuffer, delivering brutal hits and disrupting plays constantly. Peppers is an athlete, lining up all over the field at Michigan, who excells when playing in the box but has coverage ability as well. The former first round pick played linebacker and cornerback in college and will look to captialize on that experience and put it to good use. If Peppers starts, he can help the linebackers in coverage, something which was exploited last season. No matter who starts, both players will see the field plenty as they are young and extremely talented.

#### Prediction

Jabrill Peppers will start, he has a broader skill set and is more athletic, but Kindred will be impacting plays and stuffing runs on a regular basis.

## Linebacker

The Browns have 4 starting caliber players vying for 3 spots. When Mychal Kendricks was brought in, the competion truly became fierce and every player knew their spot was up for grabs. The group was a bright spot for the Browns last season but looks to grow and improve with the addition of Kendricks. If he does not start, he will at least allow players to get a breather during the game, as Christian Kirksey and Joe Schobert were forced to play every defensive snap last season. The group however was weak in pass coverage, being exploited by opposing quarterbacks and constantly giving up chunks of yardage to tight ends and running backs. With heightened competition, expect all 4 to focus and refine their skillsets.

#### Prediction

Jamie Collins will start, he simply is too good not to when healthy, but the other 2 spots are uncertain. Kirksey has been around for years and commands the defense, and Kendricks is extremely valuable in the passing game so I give them the nods and move pro bowler Joe Schobert to the bench despite leading the league in tackles last season. All 4 will play plenty and may see time when they are all out there at once.

### Other Battles to watch

While listed above may be the most covered by the media, John Dorsey has brought in so many new faces that there is competition at every spot. Other key battles to watch for this offseason include wide receiver, left guard, and defensive tackle. With Josh Gordon's absence, the wide receiver position is lacking and the coaches are searching for players to step up. Rashard Higgins and C.J. Board are lesser known names whom have surprised and showed out so far. With Joel Bitonio sliding outside to tackle, the left guard position is now up for grabs. Austin Corbett, the teams 33rd selection this spring, leads the race but its far from over. Lastly, with the youth and lack of proven players at defensive tackle potent, the position still has question marks as to whom will start.
