After being brought in last season, Gregg Williams vastly revamped the Browns defense, forming a front around stars Jamie Collins and Myles Garrett. With a lack of cornerback speed, Williams was forced to play multiple players out of position, such as Jabrill Peppers playing the "angel" saftey and often lining up close to 20 yards down field. With a revamped secondary and youthful defensive line, Cleveland's defense looks to build on last year and surprise teams this year. Below we look into a few key backups, many of which have been brought in the past 2 years.

## Mychal Kendricks

After winning a super bowl, the Eagles and Kendricks parted ways, enabling the Browns to strengthen a position group which already bolsters 3 starting caliber players. Kendricks however has superior ability is pass coverage, an area the linebacker core was riddicled upon last year. If he does not make his way into the starting linebackers, Kendricks will at least be a major contributor off the bench. He also enables Kirksey and Schobert to come off the field, a feat neither has done since 2016.

## Terrance Mitchell

A familiar face to John Dorsey, Mitchell was aquired after a breakout season with the Chiefs that saw his breakup 18 passes and intercept another 4. Throughout camp, Mitchell has shined and may even play himself into a starting spot, but with rookie Denzel Ward being lockdown and T.J. Carrie's hefty contract, Mitchell must continue to show out. At a minimum, Mitchell will play when 3 receivers are on the field and it's an obvious passing situation but he just might find himself starting too.

## Derrick Kindred

A brutal run stopper out of TCU, Kindred was a bright spot for the Brown's defense before going down with a broken wrist. With Jabrill Peppers returning to his natural position at strong saftey, the two will battle for one spot, but Peppers coverage ability and athleticism give him the nod. Kindred will most definitley see the field, likely entering to disrupt runs and punish any players who come his way. He and Peppers may end up splitting time or with a good enough showing, he has the ability to start this season and has shown he is capable.

## Caleb Brantley

A 6th round selection in last years draft, Brantley appeared in double digit games and displayed the skillset that had scouts giving him as high as second round grades. While he won't start and has suffered minor injuries throughout camp, Brantley will be a key rotational piece for the Browns and will see plenty of action. After the trade of Danny Shelton this offseason, Gregg Williams and the Browns defensive coaches illustrated their belief in the Browns youthful front 4, Ogunjobi, Coley, and Brantley must step up and make light of that decision.

## Chad Thomas

A 3rd round selection this offseason, the former Miami standout will be a key rotational player along the entire Browns defensive line, impacting plays off the edge and inside, particularly on third downs. When Garrett or Ogbah comes off, both Thomas and Nassib must fill and and still have a presence. On passing downs, Thomas has the size and ability to go inside and blow past lineman, something the front has lacked for years.
