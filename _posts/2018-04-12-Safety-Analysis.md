## Safety
<br>

### Starter: Jabrill Peppers

Last year, Peppers played the "angel" safety role for the Browns, lining up more than 20 yards behind the line of scrimmage, and a was a colssal failure as Peppers missed multiple open field tackles and was out of almost every play. This season, the former Michigan do-it-all will return back to a more natural position, strong saftey, where he hopes to develop and bud into a star. The former first round pick is capable of covering tight ends when needed and can be a proficient run stopper.

#### Roster Chance: 100%

### Starter: Damarious Randall

The Browns aquired Randall from the Packers, trading Kizer and swapping picks as well. While it was suprising the Browns gave up on Kizer so soon, Randall is a very solid and capable player who will immediatley start at free safety for the Browns, a position in which the Browns struggled with throughout the year. The former first round pick should pair well with Peppers and can cause turnovers, something seriously lacking for the Browns defense in 2017.

#### Roster Chance: 99%

<br>

### Backup: Derrick Kindred

A fourth round pick out of TCU, Kindred has grown into a very solid player for the Browns, starting every game last season until he was plagued with injuries. With the addition of Randall, Kindred will likely fill in behind Peppers but is a phenomenal run stopper who can also excell on special teams. The 24 year old will be apart of Browns plans in the future in some way as he continue to grow and improve.

#### Roster Chance: 90%

<br>

### Reserve: Kai Nacua

An undrafted free agent signed by the Browns, Nacua eventually saw himself starting for the Browns when the secondary was hit with a plethora of injuries. The 6'1" safety out of BYU was alright but showed little promise of developing into much more than a reserve. Nacua will compete for the backup free saftey position but the Browns will likely bring in a rookie and Nacua will be cut. 

#### Roster Chance: 10%

<br>

### Reserve: Derron Smith

A former 6th round draft pick out of Fresno State, Smith was signed by the Browns from the Bengals practice squad in November and stuck with the team for the rest of the year. Smith is a free saftey who hopes to backup Randall but already at the age of 26, it would be suprising to see him in a Browns uniform during the 2018 season.

#### Roster Chance: 5%

<br>

### Reserve: Justin Currie

Currie was brought into Cleveland in 2016 originally and was on and off the team and practice squad until being activated to the active roster in December. Currie is a 6'2" strong saftey who will almost definitley be cut with Peppers and Kindred in front of him.

#### Roster Chance: 2%

<br>

### Additional Aquisitions

The Browns have most definitley strengthened the position this offseason, particularly by aquiring Randall and moving Peppers back to his natural position. Peppers also should develop and improve in his second year and can help the linebackers in coverage. Despite this, the Browns still may look to add another free saftey to compete and earn a starting or backup spot on the roster.

### Position Grade: B+

By adding one player, Damarious Randall, both saftey positions improved and should continue to develop with the young players demanding those roles. Randall and Peppers will return to more natural roles for them and should each become solid starters at a minimum. Kindred is also a phenomenal young safety who will improve and can be a vital piece for the Browns secondary.
