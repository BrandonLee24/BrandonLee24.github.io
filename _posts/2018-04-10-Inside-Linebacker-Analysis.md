## Inside/Middle Linebacker
<br>

### Starter: Joe Schobert

The only pro bowler from the Browns last season, Schobert hopes to continue his improve and post similar, if not even better numbers than last season, when he led the league with 144 tackles. The former 4th round pick also added 3 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, and an interception to compile an impressive resume. Starting all 16 games last year, Schobert made a seamless transition to middle linebacker and earned the nod as the leader of the defense when Tank Carder went down before the season began. With a year under his belt as the captain of the defense, Schobert should excell and possibly even improve in 2018, forming a strong linebacker corps with Jamie Collins and Christian Kirksey.

#### Roster Chance: 100%

### Backup: Tank Carder

The 29 year old Carder was expected to start at middle linebacker last season until he went down with an injury, but the Browns decided to bring him back to camp again this year. While he will be battling for a backup position, the former TCU player hopes to remain with the team and display his ability on special teams as well. Carder has been with the team since they claimed him in 2012, but will have to put in work to guarentee a roster spot this season.

#### Roster Chance: 40%

### Reserve: B.J. Bello

Bello appeared in all 16 games for the Browns, registering 6 tackles as mainly a special teams player. The former Illinois State linebacker will enter his second year with hopes of being the Browns backup middle linebacker, but at a crowded spot with a guarenteed starter, Bello's odds of making the team do not seem so bright unless he is able to capitalize on his special teams skills.

#### Roster Chance: 20%

### Reserve: Austin Calitro

The former Villanova linebacker, Calitro remains an outcast to make the Browns opening day roster despite being just 24. Unless the man whom has never played in an NFL game is able to display talent, Calitro may be searching for his 5th team in just 2 years. 

#### Roster Chance: 5%

### Reserve: Max Bullough

Signed by the Browns as a free agent in January, Bullough hopes to display his abilities that saw him play in all 16 games in 2016. The former undrafted free agent out of Michigan State was a solid backup for the Houston Texans for 3 years, but when released last season, he did not land on an NFL roster all season. With the Browns, the 26 year old hopes to illustrate his skills he showed in 2016 and earn the spot as the backup middle linebacker.

### Additional Aquisitions

Despite having the only Browns player who made the pro bowl at the position, I am not sold on our middle linebacker corps. Carder has never shown much ability and the rest of the group would be satisfied to simply backup Schobert. With his coverage woes, the Browns could bring in another linebacker or move Kirksey back to the inside and attempt to strengthen the position group. At the minimum, the Browns should draft or at least sign another linebacker to compete and develop, partcularly one whom has coverage ability.

### Position Grade: B

Joe Schobert is a hard working, scrapy player who is willing to get down and dirty tackling but has his downsides as well, particularly in coverage. He has proven himself in all aspects of his game except this which could lead the Browns to bring in a new face to compete. Also, the Browns don't have a surefire solid backup, as Carder returns from a season-ending injury and the rest of the group has never really displayed much talent.
