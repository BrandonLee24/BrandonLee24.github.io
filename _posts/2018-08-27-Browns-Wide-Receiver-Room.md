The Browns have repeatedly been in talks with Dez Bryant, reportedly offering the former all-pro a deal worth less than 5 million dollars, begging the question is the corps too weak that it needs to add another body?

## Jarvis Landry, Josh Gordon, Antonio Callaway, Rashard Higgins

The 4 locks within the room, each a guarentee to make the roster barring any injury in the last 2 weeks before the season, will be key contributors this year catching passes from Tyrod Taylor. Landry will keep his competitive nature and will allow the others to be freed up. Gordon is an explosive athlete and if he is able to stay on the field, the former all-pro could lead the league in receiving yards again. Tyrod Taylor is considered a conservative quarterback, but with Gordon's size and speed he could surely look downfield more. Higgins has stepped up and earned first team reps, a year after being cut, the Colorado State product has earned his keep this year. Rounding out the group is the troubled Callaway, a rookie out of Florida who has shined but also was pulled over at 3 in the morning and failed to tell his coaches. Callaway has starting potential but injuries and issues have slowed his roll this offseason and the Browns need to keep him out of trouble.

## Bubble watch

Damion Ratley, Jeff Janis, C.J. Board, Da'Mari Scott, 4 players battling for 2 spots. Ratley, a 6th round pick, appears to be a lock, but the other spot is completely up for grabs. Janis was the favorite heading into camp, mentioned due to his special teams ability, but a shaky offseason in which he had a special teams penatly in a game has loosened his grip on the final spot. Board has stepped up, particularly on the second team, and could snag the final spot or appear on the teams practice squad. Scott, an undrafted free agent, is in the same boat as board, flashing potential but not enough to secure a spot.

## Dez Bryant

The Dez debacle, the team wanted to sign him and may still end up doing so, but as of right now the Browns and Bryant are unable to reach an agreement. The former Oklaoma State stud would immediatley impact the team, likely becoming a proven 4th or 5th receiver and boosting the players around him. Of course, the team must be weary of his persona and adding another personality to the locker room could cause troubles. The debate for the Browns is whether Byrant would take snaps from youthful players and hinder their ability to develop, but if John Dorsey believes that is worth it, then by all means the Browns should try to be the best they can this year.

## Cutdowns

Each team can only keep 53 players on their roster, often leading to capable players without a team. The Browns have previously found gems such as Briean Boddy-Calhoun on the waivers and could look to add a player again this year. Most NFL rosters contain 6 or 7 receivers, leaving those who remain scrapping for a roster spot with other teams. The Browns could also simply add one or more of these players to their practice squad and look to develop them and mold them into NFL caliber players. Rashard Higgins is a prime example of a player who was cut, put on the practice squad, then thrown into game action.

## Final Prediction

I expect the Browns to keep 6 receivers on their 53 man roster, the core 4 listed above, Damion Ratley, and Dez Bryant. I believe the team and Bryant can reach a deal and the former all-pro will put on an orange jersey again, one in which he flourished in in college.
