The Cleveland Browns enter the second half of the 2018 season with a new head coach. Former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams is the new interim head coach while Freddie Kitchens will be the offensive coordinator. The Cheifs boast a 7-1 record while the Browns are 2-5-1. Kansas City leads the series all time 12-11-2, winning 3 of the last 4 matchups. Below we dicuss what to expect from the Browns in their week 9 matchup.

## Ground and Pound

<br>

Freddie Kitchens will be calling his first professional game and expect him to use a simply offense, relying heavily on Nick Chubb and Duke Johnson out of the backfield. The Cheifs defensive line is not quite as stout as the Steelers so expect a better performace from both backs this week. Chubb has shown the ability to fight for extra yards, while Johnson is a savvy pass catcher who does damage in space. Kitchens will look to feed both as he was formerly the teams running backs coach.

## Stretch the Field

<br>

The Browns are already lacking proven playmakers and need to help Baker Mayfield out. The offensive line has been exploited all year and Mayfield knows he needs to get the ball out quick. Expect Kitchens to set up numerous screens and quick throws, later baiting the Chiefs forwards and using Antonio Callaway's speed to burn them deep. Also, quick throws will stretch the defense and open up the run game.

## Mixed Defensive Packages

<br>

The Chiefs offense has exploded all season, racking up points on every defense. Their season low is 27 points and Patrick Maholmes has burst onto the scene. Gregg Williams will have a real challenge trying to slow the Chiefs down but expect him to mix up looks and packages in an attempt to confuse the second year quarterback. Agaist the Steelers, the Browns had minimal pressure and could look to dial up the blitzes. There is a large risk with doing so however, as Tyreek Hill can burn a secondary in a heartbeat.

<br>

## Final Prediction 

<br>

Browns - 38
Chiefs - 28

<br>

The Offense hits a stride and totals 4 touchdowns while the defense causes mayhem for Maholmes and finds the endzone once themselves. Gregg Williams confuses the second year quarterback all night and numerous turnovers help the Browns capture the victory and improve to 3-5-1 on the season.
