Gaines was brought to Cleveland on a one-year deal and has been decently impactful, playing the most snaps out of all Browns cornerbacks against the Bills. He was fighting for a starting cornerback spot opposite Denzel Ward but the injury was reported to be significant and Gaines likely will miss some time.

The 26 year old cornerback has struggled with injuries in the past. With him out, T.J. Carrie, Briean Boddy-Calhoun, Terrance Mitchell will continue to headline the list of canidates for the second starting job while Mike Jordan, Jeremiah McKinnon, Denzel Rice and more will look to provide depth.
