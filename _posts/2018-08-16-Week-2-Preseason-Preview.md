The Browns captured a win in week 1 of preseason, defeating the Giants 20-10, and this week the Browns will open at home against the Buffalo Bills, a team which the Browns just traded former first round pick Corey Coleman. Below, we dive into a few key things to watch in the Browns second preseason game.

## Starting Offensive Line

It was reported this past week that Greg Robinson was taking reps as the starting left tackle and that Joel Bitonio had returned to left guard. If this is true, the whole Browns offense could be different this week and it will be interesting to see how Todd Haley schemes with the potential new look. If Robinson does start, Corbett will return to second team duties and the Browns run game will likely be bolstered after an abysmal 33 rushes for 50 yards last game.

## Cornerbacks

Denzel Ward has lived up to the hype so far, but with constant posts of Jarvis Landry making one handed catches over the Browns cornerbacks, it will be interesting to see who starts and who earns the most reps. Terrance Mitchell has earned the starting nod opposite Ward so far, but T.J. Carrie, E.J. Gaines, and others are right on his tail. The slot role may fluctuate as well, with Carrie in a battle with Briean Boddy-Calhoun. With a completely revamed secondary, week 2 should enable fans to get an idea as to how the back end of the Browns defense will unfold.

## Baker Mayfield

Obviously, the first overall draft pick will alwasy be interesting to watch to see how he has developed and if he can live up to the hype. Last week, Mayfield completed 11 of 20 passes, 2 of which were for touchdowns. The coaching staff will hope to see the former heisman build off this performance as he gears up for his second NFL game. Despite playing against backups, Mayfield was solid and illustrated numerous traits which led to his selection as the first overall pick. He also showed increased pocket awareness and the ability to command an offense under center.

## Wide Receivers

The Receivers have been the talk as of late, with the trade of Corey Coleman and Josh Gordon's absence, but the likes of Rashard Higgins and Antonio Callaway will attempt to show coaches no outside players will need to be brought in. The team has been working out multiple players, including former pro bowler Dez Bryant, but the current core will hope to shut down these rumors and illustrate that the group still has plenty of skill. Callaway shined last game and could be pivotal this season opposite Jarvis Landry, but he possesses numerous off the field issues and remains a liability.

## Defensive Front

We all know how talented Myles Garrett and Emmanuel Ogbah are, but it still will be intriguing to watch the Browns front 4 and see if they are capable of disrupting the run game and generating pressure on the Bill's quarterbacks. The team worked out former Colt Johnathan Hankins this week, a disruptive defensive tackle who could add to the teams depth at the position. Ogunjobi, Brantley, and Meder will hope to lock down a position this week as a starting defensive tackle with Trevon Coley out.
