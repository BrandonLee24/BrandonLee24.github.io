## Special Teams

<br>

### Kicker: Zane Gonzalez

A 7th round selection last season, Gonzalez had his ups and downs, starting off rough, but ended the year on a positive note and earned some confidence back. Entering 2018, Gonzalez appears to be set to start again for the Browns, with his big leg being very helpful on kickoffs. The former Lou Groza award winner may see competition in camp but will be familiar with the team and should be a solid bet to start.

#### Roster Chance: 90%

### Punter: Britton Colquitt

Signed by the Browns in 2016, Colquitt has been a staple on the the Browns special teams ever since, launching punts consistently. The 33 year old Colquitt may be slowing down and could be in for a run with a rookie or free agent this year, but he has never placed any doubts into the minds of the Cleveland coaches about his ability.

#### Roster Chance: 75%

<br>

### Long Snapper: Charley Hughlett

Hughlett, the Browns long snapper since 2014, is set to start and command the position again this season, especially after signing a contract extension just last year. The former Central Florida player has been a solid special teams player for the Browns and appears set to continue in his role. 

#### Roster Chance: 90%

### Punt Return Man: Jabrill Peppers

The former first round draft pick was the lead punt return man for the Browns last season and showed why multiple times, displaying freak athleticism and making men miss. While he did not excell on defense, his special teams potential is through the roof and the Browns hope he is able to reach that with a season under his belt. 

#### Roster Chance: 100%

<br>

### Kick Return Man: Jabrill Peppers

Peppers also was commonly out returning kicks as well, but will see a little more competition in this spot, from Matthew Dayes and potentially another rookie. Peppers simply has the most ability and the highest ceiling however and seems set on starting in this spot. If he is able to stay healthy, Peppers could be a force on the Browns special teams for years to come.

#### Roster Chance: 100%

### Additional Aquisitions

The Browns have solid foundations at every position and their special teams players were solid last season, but they could use a younger punter and competition for Gonzalez and Peppers. The rest of the special teams has seen improvement as well, with the addition of Jeff Janis especially, and should be better as a whole at limiting returns with Amos Jones coaching. The Browns likely will target some speedy rookies whom can help their special teams as well.

<br>

### Position Grade: B

The Browns clearly have talent at every position listed here but they also have inconsistencies. Gonzalez missed multiple easy kicks before calming down at the end of the year, Colquitt had his first punt of the season blocked and recovered for a touchdown, and Peppers suffered injuries and had a few mistakes as well. If the group is able to grow and stabalize, the Browns should have a very strong special teams for years to come.
