Just as the Browns trade away Corey Coleman and put faith into their rookie Antonio Callaway, the former Florida product is cited for marijuana possession. As a Gator, Callaway had off the field issues and even failed his drug test at the combine, but throughout the offseason the rookie appeared to be doing well, earning his way to the first team offense. With Josh Gordon out, the trade of Coleman, and the loss of 2017 receiving leader Ricardo Louis to a season ending injury, the Browns front office must act swiftly and eye potential replacements.

Callaway was selected in the 4th round and the Browns knew they were taking a risk. Hopefully, the speedy receiver is able to gather himself and learn from his mistakes, but in the mean time the Browns must bring in more receivers. Rashard Higgins will now be the teams second best option, with Jeff Janis and C.J. Board shortly behind. When the 2017 season ended, the staff was sure to address the position, but with injuries and off the field issues, the position appears to be just as bad except Jarvis Landry.

There are numerous free agents available, Dez Bryant, Brandon Coleman, Malcom Mitchell, Eli Rodgers, and more, or the Browns could look to do what they just did with Coleman and aquire a player for a late round draft pick and mold him into a capable player in Todd Haley's scheme. John Dorsey could and hopefully does listen to Jarvis Landry and chases after Odell, a 25 year old generational talent who would have an immediate impact. The move may be costly but now the Browns will be forced to play their hand and make moves.
