## Todd Haley

<br>

The Browns best signing of 2018 was Todd Haley, the former offensive coordinator for the Pittsburg Steelers. The prior 4 seasons he had led the division rival steelers to a top-7 finish in total offense, building a successful trio with Ben Roethlisberger, Le'veon Bell, and Antonio Brown. Last season, the 0-16 Browns' offense was abysmal, finishing dead last in points per game at just under 15. The Haley led Steelers averaged 10 more points per game, enabling them to actually win games. While Haley may seem like a small addition, he brings more to the team then most realize, adding to the change of culture the team wants.

Proven, another person brought in by John Dorsey whom is proven. Tyrod Taylor has a winning record and led a team to the playoffs last season, Jarvis Landry led the league in receptions last season, and Todd Haley has displayed an effective, winning offense in Pittsburg for years. He adds to the winning culture implemented by the Browns front offense and will attempt to build an offense around Tyrod Taylor, a smaller, more mobile quarterback then Big Ben. Based on past performance and record, expect the Browns offense to be completely reworked and improved, potentially even talented enough to finishing top ten in the league in scoring.

Hue Jackson simply was trying too hard to no avail, being the head coach is hard enough, watching every player, making lineup and roster decisions, running a team is no dainty task. Jackson has been doing this for 2 seasons, as well as running the offense and mentoring quarterbacks, simply an overhaul for one person. This season, the likes of Ken Zampose, Todd Haley, and co will relive that pressure off Jackson and allow him to focus on the whole team and enthrawl himself in improving the Browns. No more excuses, Jackson underwent a cleanse this offseason by jumping into Lake Erie and now has to prove himself, he has no where to hide, this is his team and he must take the reigns. Hiring Todd Haley and others has freed up the head coach to fulfill his duties, something the Browns should have done since day 1 when Jackson was hired in 2016.

Todd Haley brings in knowledge of other teams, specifically divisional rivals, as well. Over the past 7 years coaching the Steelers he has become very familiar with the Bengals, Ravens, and the Steelers offenses. He will be able to team not only the offense but the defense as well, giving them tips and pointers on how to cover the likes of Antonio Brown and Le'veon Bell. He also understands the opposing teams' defenses and can strategize around that, countering their game plans and giving the Browns the edge. Paired with a quarterback who does not force turnovers, the Browns offense should be much improved by the underated signing of Todd Haley.
