## Tight End

<br>

### Starter: David Njoku

Drafted in the first round last year, the 21 year old Njoku displayed his freak athletecism and talent all season, as well as his youthfulness. An athletic freak Njoku excited Browns fans, totalling 386 yards and 4 touchdowns on 32 receptions, but as he ages and adjusts to the system, expect the numbers to rise. Also, with the addition of Jarvis Landry and the return of Josh Gordon, Njoku should see more open space and more sumo spikes. David Njoku should be a force on the Browns offense for many years, and the 6'4" former Miami stud plans to do just that.

#### Roster Chance: 100%

### Starter: Darren Fells

The Browns may not start two tight ends depending on their initial scheme, but if they do, expect Fells to join Njoku on the field.  Signed in March by the Browns, Fells will compete with Telfer for the 3rd tightend spot, and due to his contract and experiece, I expect Fells to remain on the roster and become the blocking tight end for the Browns. At 6'7", Fells recoreded 17 receptions for 177 yards a 3 touchdowns, and for the Browns, Fells could slip out and become a red zone option.

#### Roster Chance: 70%

### Backup: Seth Devalve

Drafted as a developmental player, Devalve has been just that, showing talent as a receiver but also displaying some inconsistency. In his second season last year, Devalve had 33 receptions for 395 yards, forming a solid receiving pairing with David Njoku. With a solid quarterback option now in the building, if Devalve is able to progress and impress the Browns staff, he should maintain his role as a second receiving tight end whom can get open and be a factor for the offense. Entering his third season, this could be a make or break year for the former Princeton standout.

#### Roster Chance: 70%

<br>

### Reserve: Randall Telfer

The 2017 Cleveland Browns Walter Payton Man of the Year, Randall Telfer has been a regular for the Browns the past 2 seasons, playing in 30 games. Despite starting 19 of the games, Telfer has only caught 5 passes, displaying his true skills as a blocker. While he has been sufficient, Telfer is now in a tough spot as the Browns signed vetran Darren Fells this offseason, a witty blocker who has shown more ability to be a receiving threat. For Telfer to make the roster, he pretty much must beat out Fells and showcase he is more than just a blocking tight end. 

#### Roster Chance: 25%

<br>

### Reserve: Matt Lengel

After winning a superbowl with the Patriots in 2016, Lengel was waived in 2017 and quickly brought into Cleveland, where he played in just one game, recording no stats. The mammoth out of Eastern Kentucky is a longshot to stay with the team, as he is already 27 and has only 2 career receptions. Unless he improves drastically this season, Lengel will be cut and be searching for his 4th career team.

#### Roster Chance: 5%

<br>

### Reserve: Gavin Escobar

The vetran out of San Diego State, Escobar was an effective backup for the Cowboys from 2013-2016, playing in every game except 2 during that time, but when he became a free agent and signed with the Ravens, Escobar only appeared in 2 games and never recorded an offensive statistic. The 27 year old has proven he can be a valuable backup before but those years may be behind him and unless he is able to display his skills from his time with the Cowboys, Escobar will not make the roster.

#### Roster Chance: 3%

<br>

### Additional Aquisitions

The Browns have about all they could ask for at the position, 2 young, talented prospects who have flashed talent in Njoku and Devalve, and a vetran who is a talented blocker and leader in Fells. While there are some intruiging tight ends in this years draft class, it would be odd if the Browns were to invest in another tight end. 

<br>

### Position Grade: B+

The position displays youth and talent but little has truly been proven by the Browns tight ends. As Njoku enters his second year and Devalve enters his third, they both should look to improve and the tight end position should become a strength for the Browns. With the ability to disrupt defenses in the middle of the field, these big bodied targets should also help other receivers get open.
