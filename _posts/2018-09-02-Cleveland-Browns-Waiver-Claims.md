With first choice of all the players cut yesterday, the Cleveland Browns added 5 players, 1 on offense and 4 on defense. 2 players cut by the Browns, cornerbacks Simeon Thomas and Mike Jordan, were claimed by teams today as well.

## Offense

#### OL Aaron Neary

<br>

Neary, an undrafted free agent in 2016, was on the Rams' practice squad all last year before starting in their final game of the regular season. The 6-4, 300 pound lineman is listed as a center.

## Defense

#### DL Carl Davis

A former 3rd round pick in 2015, Davis has battled injuries throughout his career, but he can impact the team as a rotational player inside. 

<br>

#### DE Ifeadi Odenigo

A former 7th round selection by the Minnesota Vikings, Odenigbo trasitioned to a three technique and registered 11 tackles, 2 sacks, and 8 quarterback hits this preseason.

<br>

#### LB Tanner Vallejo

A 6th round pick by the Buffalo Bills in 2017, Vallejo will look to add depth to the Browns' linebacker core. He played 15 games last year, registering 4 tackles as he mostly played special teams.

#### DB Tavierre Thomas

Thomas, an undrafted free agent this year, was cut by the Arizona Cardinals. The 6 foot defensive back will hope to contribute on special teams and add depth.
