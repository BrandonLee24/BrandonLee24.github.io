## Defensive Tackle

<br>

### Starter: Trevon Coley

After an impressive spring and summer last season, Coley earned a spot as a starting defensive tackle and played 15 games, amassing 41 tackles and 2 sacks. Out of Florida Atlantic, Coley will hope to build off his past season and improve in all areas. The Florida native is a hard working player who looks to start again this season, bar any new aquisitions.

#### Roster Chance: 95%

### Starter: Larry Ogunjobi

Drafted in the 3rd round last season, Ogunjobi impressed, seeing time in 14 games and displaying his skills as a run stopper. With Danny Shelton gone, the North Carolina-Charlotte product appears set to start and play a vital role in the Browns front line. 

#### Roster Chance: 99%

<br>

### Backup: Caleb Brantley

Coming out of Florida, Brantley entered the draft with some controversy, leading to him falling to the 6th round where the Browns snatched him up. As a rookie, Brantley saw the field in 12 games and impressed, totaling 2 sacks and double didget tackles. Entering his second year, he will continue to improve and be pivotal along the Browns defensive front.

#### Roster Chance: 90%

### Backup: Jamie Meder

After blocking a field goal which resulted in the Browns first and only win in 2016, Meder became well-known among Browns fans. Last season, Meder played in 10 games before suffering a season ending injury, and entering his 5th season, he hopes to continue to succeed in his role as a backup. With an injury and more new, young players taking over, Meder could see his role diminishingm, especially if another tackle is aquired.

#### Roster Chance: 60%

<br>

### Reserve: Jeremy Faulk

Faulk was signed in January after the Jets waived him last season and will compete in camp for a spot on the team. If he makes it, Faulk would be a backup/reserve whom would rotate in whenever players needed a break.

#### Roster Chance: 25%

###Additional Aquisitions

The Browns are young at defensive tackle and have hopes that the group will improve, but they definitely should look to add another playmaker here, particularly someone who can penetrate and get after the quarterback. The draft offers multiple options and at worst, the Browns should aquire another depth player.

### Position Grade: B

<br>

Despite being young and having some talented, the group is not proven and has very little depth. The Browns need to find another talent here, whether in the draft, a trade, or a free-agent, whom is athletic and can increase competition and disrupt the quarterback. If the Browns draft a player such as Bradley Chubb, he, Myles Garrett, and Emanuel Ogbah could all see the field on third downs.
