## Kirk Cousins

Cousins leads the free agent quarterbacks, and despite only holding a career 24-23 record as a starter, the former Washington Redskins quarterback is likely to be the highest paid NFL player. The former Michigan State superstar was taken by the Redskins in the 4th round, in the same draft when they took Robert Griffin III.  Last year, Cousins boasted a 64.3 completion percentage for 4093 yards, with 27 touchdowns to 13 interceptions. He has a career completion percentage of 65.5 and has started all 16 games for Washington the past 3 years, leading them to 9, 8, and 7 win seasons. All in all, Cousins is a competent quarterback, and in a league desperate for any taste of skill at the position, expect a simply above average player to become the highest paid.

#### Expected Team: New York Jets

The Jets have a youthful roster and the 6th pick in the draft, and with their cap situation, close to 100 million, expect them to literally throw money at Cousins. With Alex Smith committed to signing, the Redskins will wave goodbye to the Kirk Cousins Era.

## A.J. McCarron

McCarron, out of Alabama, has been granted a restricted free agent by an arbitrator, likely ending his tenure as a Cincinnati Bengal. Despite playing in only 3 games last year, totaling a measly 14 pass attempts, teams appear to be willing to take a chance on the career backup. The 27 year old has a 64.7 completion percentage and 6 touchdowns in his career, all coming in the 2015 season. The former 5th round pick became an unrestricted free agent on February 15th and seems destined to sign elsewhere, caping off his 4 year tenure with the Bengals.

#### Expected Team: Cleveland Browns

The Cleveland Brown, owners of an 0-16 record, attempted to trade for McCarron at the trade deadline, but failed to do so. Now that they will be able to sign McCarron for free, I expect him to reunite with Jackson. If the Browns do sign McCarron, expect them to trade out of the 1st pick to aquire more talent to surround their new quarterback.

## Case Keenum

One of the most polarizing and unexpected stars of the 2017 season, Keenum hits free agency along with 2 other Vikings. He posted an impressive 98.3 rating in 2017, completing 67.6 percent of his passes for 22 touchdowns and 7 interceptions. Keenum was able to lead the Vikings to the NFC championship game once Sam Bradford went down for the season. The career backup, Keenum was signed for just 2 million dollars as a saftey valve last year, but now commands a large contract and a starting spot. The 30 year old holds the record amond NCAA Division 1 FBS career passing yards leaders with 19,217, and passed for over 3 and a half thousand yards in 15 games last year. Expect the former undrafted free agent to find a hefty contract this season.

#### Expected Team: Minnesota Vikings

After taking the reigns and leading the Vikings to the NFC Championship, Minnesota will not be able to let him walk. Keenum was stable all year and did not turn the ball over, a skill coveted by teams across the league. Also, unlike Bradford and Bridgewater, Keenum has the least injury history. The 6 year pro will stay in town and maintain the starting job.

## Teddy Bridgewater

With the 32nd pick of the 2014 NFL draft, the Vikings selected Teddy Bridgewater, their presumed QB of the future. The former Louisville gunslinger started 12 games his rookie season, posting a solid 64.4 completion percentage, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. The following year, he lead the Vikings to the playoffs, starting every game that year and posting over 3,200 yards. Despite low touchdown totals, the Vikings were content with their future at the quarterback position. Unfortunatley, over the next 2 years, Bridgewater only saw the field once, for 2 pass attempts last year, one of which was intercepted. As Bridgewater completes his recovery from a brutal knee injury, teams are still willing to give him a chance, at just 25 years old he still shows promis.

<BR>
  
#### Expected Team: Minnesota Vikings

Despite the injuries he has sustained, the Vikings obviously believe in him and his talent, not only by drafting him in the 1st round, but by keeping him on the roster despite the gruesome knee injury that almost saw him losing his leg. Expect Keenum to start, but Bridgewater is a capable backup if healthy and if Keenum regresses or is hit by age, Bridgewater can return to being the starter.

<BR>

## Sam Bradford

The former 1st overall pick is an unrestricted free agent this year, and at the age of 30, is a capable starter. After playing at Oklahoma from 2006-2009, the Saint Louis Rams (Now the L.A. Rams) made Bradford the first pick, with him immediatley starting all 16 games that season. For a rookie, Bradford was solid, with a 60 percent completion percentage and over 3,500 yards. Unfortunatley, since then Bradford has only played all 16 games once, in 2012, where he led the Rams to a 7-8-1 record. In 2014, Bradford missed the entire year, and in 2017 he only saw the field twice, heading to the IR after a knee injury, which has derailed his career, struck again. The Oklahoma product has proven himself on the field, with nearly 20,000 career passing yards, but teams are fearful to sign him to a contract due to his extensive injury history.

#### Expected Team: Denver Broncos

The Broncos, owners of the 5th pick, will take a swing on the former 1st overall pick and will draft a QB. Despite having a solid defence, the Broncos have been unable to find a solid, consistent play-caller. Bradford has proven himself on the field, completing over 70 percent of passes in 15 games in 2016, but the Broncos know there is a liability and that he may not be the future, therefore they will pair him with a rookie he can mentor.

<BR>
  
## Josh McCown

How he is still in 1 piece is a miracle. At the age of 38, McCown has taken some serious blows on multiple teams and has seen his body crumble as a result. Last year, the Jets starter was on the field for the first offensive snap in 13 of the games, tied for his career most (2004 ARI). The Sam Houston State product is well reknown, however, as a phenomenal QB coach and mentor and someone who truly understands the game. Last year, the Browns attempted to sign McCown as a coach to help develop their quarterback room. Expect McCown to continue his role as a vetran mentor or possibly a bridge quarterback, but with his injury liability, teams may not rely on him to play much.

<BR>
  
#### Expected Team: Chicago Bears

McCown previously played for the Bears, from 2011-2013, and he would make sense for them to sign. The Bears have their quarterback of the future in 2nd overall pick Mitchell Tribusky, but he did not perform up to expectations last year and could use a vetran to guide him this offseason and throughout the year. The bears will likely sign McCown to be their backup as well, replacing the underachieving Mike Glennon.
