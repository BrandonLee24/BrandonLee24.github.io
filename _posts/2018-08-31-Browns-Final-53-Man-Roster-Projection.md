# Offense

<br>

## Quarterback (3)

-Tyrod Taylor

-Baker Mayfield

-Drew Stanton

Missed the Cut - Brogan Roback

<br>

The only question here is whether or not the team decides to keep Stanton, a witty vet and mentor to Mayfield. I expect them to do so to help the rookie grow and be a security blanket in case Taylor gets injured. Roback has shown enough to earn him a spot on the practice squad, displaying size and arm strength.

<br>

## Running Back (4)

-Carlos Hyde

-Duke Johnson

-Nick Chubb

-Matthew Dayes

Missed the Cut - Dan Vitale, Dontrell Hillard

<br>

The first surprise to many, fullback Dan Vitale missing out while Matthew Dayes sneaks onto the roster. Dayes, once the second to last pick in the 2016 draft, shined last night against the Lions and offers the offense more then Vitale. His explosiveness and special teams ablity give him the nod, plus Todd Haley does not use a fullback regularly in his offense. Vitale has been injured this offseason and may not get any chance to earn his spot.

<br>

## Wide Receiver (6)

-Jarvis Landry

-Josh Gordon

-Antonio Callaway

-Rashard Higgins

-Damion Ratley

-Derrick Willies

Missed the Cut - C.J. Board, Jeff Janis, Da'Mari Scott, Blake Jackson

<br>

The top 5 on this list are practically guarentees, but the 6th spot remains open. Board shined this offseason, forming chemistry with Baker Mayfield on the second team, but a shoulder injury may ruin his chances of making the team. Janis was expected to take the final spot but he has been lackluster and never flashed much on special teams. Willies gets the spot for now but I expect either Dez Bryant or another waiver claim to occupy the last spot when the team plays the Steelers week 1.

<br>

## Tight End (3)

-David Njoku

-Darren Fells

-Devon Cajuste

Missed the Cut - Seth Devalve, Orson Charles, Stephen Baggett

<br>

Cajuste or Devalve, both have similar skill sets as receiving tight ends, but Devalve's injury results in him missing out this year. Cajuste has shined in camp and capped it off with 2 catches for 48 yards last night. The team may keep both for now and only 5 receivers, but I have been impressed by Cajuste's play and am unsure Devalve's past experience is enough to ensure his spot.

<br>

## Offensive Line (9)

-Joel Bitonio

-Austin Corbett

-J.C. Tretter

-Kevin Zeitler

-Chris Hubbard

-Desmond Harrison

-Earl Watford

-Austin Reiter

-Spencer Drango

Missed the Cut - Shon Coleman, Greg Robinson, Avery Gennesy, Anthony Fabiano, Christian DiLauro, Fred Lauina

<br>

Shon Coleman entered camp as the teams starting left tackle and could be leaving camp unemployed. He and Greg Robinson have not been impressive or shown any improvement and Harrison's upside and Drango's versatility spell disaster for both tackles. The addition of Watford adds needed depth on the inside and could end Drango's tenure with the team.

<br>

### Offensive Recap

Matthew Dayes, Dan Vitale, Seth Devalve, and Derrick Willies are battling for 2 spots, and I give the running back and receiver the nod for now, but neither's job is safe. Along the offensive line, the 9th spot is up for grabs with Drango, Coleman, and Robinson battling for it. Drango gets the edge for now due to his versatility. The only other question is whether the team keeps Stanton and I believe they do.

<br>

<br>

# Defense

<br>

## Defenive Line (9)

-Myles Garrett

-Larry Ogunjobi

-Trevon Coley

-Emmanuel Ogbah

-Chris Smith

-Caleb Brantley

-Jamie Meder

-Chad Thomas

-Carl Nassib

Missed the Cut - Nate Orchard, Jeremy Faulk, Zaycoven Henderson, Lenny Jones, Blaine Woodson, Daniel Ekuale

<br>

Nate Orchard, Carl Nassib, or neither... that is the question Gregg Williams has to answer and ultimatley I believe Nassib gets a spot. Orchard had a pick 6 yesterday and is known for his motor, but a lackluster performance in week 3 spells the end for his career with the Browns. Nassib notched a sack yesterday and has more upside then Orchard, able to provide a rush off the bench as a rotational player. The only other player who could sneak on is Jeremy Faulk, a tackle who could provide depth with Trevon Coley's current injury.

<br>

## Linebacker (6)

-Jamie Collins

-Joe Schobert

-Christian Kirksey

-Genard Avery

-James Burgess

-Justin Currie

Missed the Cut - B.J. Bello, Jermaine Grace, Brady Sheldon

<br>

With the release of Mychal Kendricks and a potential concussion sustained by Burgess, Currie makes the team and could stick. A former saftey, Currie has coverage abilities this group has lacked for years. The first four listed will rotate and see the field aplenty, Burgess can fill in when needed, and Currie will be the saftey net and coverage guy if needed.

<br>

## Cornerback (6)

-Denzel Ward

-Terrance Mitchell

-T.J. Carrie

-E.J. Gaines

-Mike Jordan

-Jeremiah McKinnon

Missed the Cut - Simeon Thomas, Denzel Rice, Christian Boutte

<br>

The first 3 are locks, Gaines will be back from a knee injury soon and will contribute, and Jordan is a depth guy with some upside. The final spot comes down to McKinnon or Thomas and as his name has been heard more and he disrupted plays across the field yesterday, I give McKinnon the nod. The 6'3 Thomas should stay with the team on the practice squad, but multiple penalties yesterday showed he is a lackluster player. The team could choose to only keep 5 cornerbacks as Briean Boddy-Calhoun is more then capable to fill in if needed.

<br>

## Saftey (4)

-Jabrill Peppers

-Demarious Randall

-Derrick Kindred

-Briean Boddy-Calhoun

Missed the Cut - Derron Smith, Elijah Campbell, Tigie Sankoh, Montrel Meader

<br>

No questions here, these 4 players will make the team and contribute in some fashion. None of the cut players showed much to the coaching staff, with penalties and poor performances throughout.

<br>

### Defensive Recap

The main decisions to be made are whether Nassib or Orchard remain, if Justin Currie is needed, and who to keep between Jeremiah McKinnon and Simeon Thomas.

<br>

<br>

# Special Teams (3)

-Zane Gonzalez

-Britton Colquitt

-Charley Hughlett

Missed the Cut - Justin Vogel

<br>

Zane Gonzalez already won the starting kicking job, beating out Ross Martin, and Colquitt takes down Vogel for the punting spot as well. Colquitt has been solid for years and is well liked by the entire team. Hughlett has been solid for years as well and remains with the team.
