## Browns Fire Hue Jackson

<br>

After leading the team to a 3-36-1 record over 2+ years, Hue Jackson has finally been fired. He has never shown any ability as a coach and has been critiqued for his entire tenure. John Dorsey will now look for a new coach whether internal or external, with the main goal to progress Baker Mayfield.

Hue Jackson followed a 1-15 season with an 0-16 season, just the second ever. Known as a players coach, the team did not improve enough for him to keep his job and finally will move on. As of now, Todd Haley remains the offensive coordinator. Josh McDaniels, Lincoln Riley, and Matt Campbell are names to remember and potential canidates for the position.
