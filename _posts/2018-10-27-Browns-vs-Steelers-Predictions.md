## Nick Chubb over 100 rushing yards

<br>

After trading Carlos Hyde prior to last week's game versus the Bucs, Nick Chubb took over the starting job and rushed 18 times for 80 yards and a touchdown. The Steelers have been stout agaist the rush ever since the Browns racked up 177 yards on the ground against them week 1, but I expect Chubb to use his powerful legs to break a few long runs. Combined with Duke Johnson, the Browns can keep the Steelers guessing as to what's coming.

## Browns win turnover battle

<br>

The Browns dominated the turnover battle in the first matchup, racking up 3 interceptions and fumbles as opposed to giving up just 1. Despite injuries along the back-end of the defense, Gregg Williams has his players flying to the ball and expect Myles Garrett to force some quick decisions from 36-year-old Ben Roethlisberger. As for the offense, Baker Mayfield has to get the ball out quick and hit his spots. This will be his first time playing the Steelers so expect a lot of mixed packages attempting to confuse the rookie.

## Jabrill Peppers returns a punt

<br>

Before fumbling in overtime last week, Peppers was showing immense promise in the punt return game. He has come close to breaking a few this year and expect him to eye some vengance after his costly turnover last week. A special teams touchdown could be huge in a tight game and could turn the momentum around completely. As long as he holds onto the ball, Peppers is a serious threat for other teams.

<br>

## David Njoku explodes

<br>

The Steelers have struggled covering tight ends all year and Njoku has began to flash the talent that made him a first round pick last year. The 22-year-old can run up the seam and give Baker Mayfield a big receiving option in the middle of the field. Look for him to use his athleticism and participate in some RPO's as well. Njoku can take some pressure off Jarvis Landry and the Browns recievers and should be keen on having a big game.

<br>

## Final Prediction 

<br>

Browns 24, Steelers 23

<br>

In what will be a chilly game, the Browns feed Nick Chubb and win the turnover battle, just barely sneaking away with a win in Pittsburg. The Browns get some big plays from their defense and special teams to ignite the offense and get the win. David Njoku and Nick Chubb light up the box score and Hue Jackson actually wins a close game.
