Flash is back, the talented receiver has returned to the team and will look to fit into his role on the Browns Offense. While fans are enthrawled with his return and immediatley want to see him and Jarvis Landry together, patience will be key. Gordon is clearly an NFL caliber receiver, he once led the league in yards in just 14 games, but as he gets acclimated with the team again, we must not rush him.

The return of Gordon may rule out the Browns signing Dez Bryant as that many characters in the locker room is a recipe for disaster. The Browns front office may continue to eye an additional body to bring in, but it appears the starting receiver positions are locked up now. If another talent is brought in, it likely will be for depth as Hue Jackson and the Brown's want to see the teams young talents develop. Antonio Callaway, Rashard Higgins, and others have proven to be more then capable of starting and catching passes.

With Gordon missing over 2 weeks of work, he will need to do a lot to catch up and the Browns will not want to overwhelm him. I do not expect him to play in the next preseason game and he may skip the last one as well as the team cares more about getting him geared up for week 1 against the Steelers. Josh left the team due to anxiety and mental issues so lets not pressure him or put too much on his plate.
