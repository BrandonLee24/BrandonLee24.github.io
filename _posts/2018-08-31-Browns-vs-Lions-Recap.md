The Cleveland Browns defeated the Detroit Lions yesterday by a score of 35-17, a resounding victory that brought some hope to fans that the team truly could be turning around. As always, there were lows and highs, many of which we will discuss below.

<br>

## Baker Mayfield

The first overall pick shined in this game despite not getting a touchdown. Mayfield completed 9 of 16 passes for 136 yards and had control of the offense the whole game, never suffering a sack and constantly extending plays. The former heisman winner likely won't see any meaningful gametime for a while, but it was exciting watching his flare. He was, for the most part, playing against backups, but he has progressed this offseason and been a bright spot for the team.

## Matthew Dayes

The second-to-last pick 2 years ago is fighting for a spot and may have earned one yesterday, totaling 77 yards and a touchdown on just 8 carries. Compared to Dontrell Hillard, Dayes clearly had more explosiveness and potential. Dan Vitale has been dealing with injuries this offseason and the team could chose to keep a 4th running back over a fullback. Ultimatley, it is up to Todd Haley to decide as to whether he needs a fullback or not.

## Devon Cajuste

The star of HBO's Hard Knocks, Cajuste may have just taken over Seth Devalve's position. Cajuste was flagged twice, but connected with Mayfield twice for 48 yards and with Devalve hurt, Cajuste could be the third tight end. He has immense ability as a pass catcher and special teams player, and as seen on hard knocks, he is willing to learn and work. A fan favorite, the former Stanford product has enough upside to stick around.

## Justin Currie

The former saftey turned linebacker played well again last night, notching 1 of the teams 2 sacks along with 6 tackles. With the release of Mychal Kendricks and James Burgess potentially suffering a concussion, Currie has a great chance to stick around in Cleveland, for now at least. As a former saftey, Currie has coverage ability, something the Browns linebackers desperatley needed last year. 5 guys appear guarentees to make the team at linebacker, and Currie could sneak on as the 6th.

## Nick Chubb

Despite mainly playing in the first quarter, Chubb shined. His heard-nosed style of running was apparent and he averaged 6.0 yards per carry in the game. He also bulldozed his way in for a touchdown and made a nice move to score the teams 2 point conversion. The trio of Chubb, Carlos Hyde, and Duke Johnson will be one to watch, Todd Haley has some real weapons to use.
