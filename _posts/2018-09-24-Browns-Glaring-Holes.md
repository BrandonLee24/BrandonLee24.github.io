Despite capturing the teams first win in over 600 days last Thursday, the team still has glaring holes remaining. These needs could be targeted through trades, free agents, or the draft next year.

### Defensive Tackle

Larry Ogunjobi has been a wrecking force this season, generating numerous pressures and 3 sacks through 3 games. Next to him, however, Trevon Coley has not been as impressive and could use an upgrade. Behind these two is very litte as well, forcing Ogunjobi to stay on the field for almost all of every game. The team could look to trade for a failed prospect or young talent now, sign a free agent in the offseason, or look to add to the youth in next years draft with countless defensive studs potentially entering. Rashan Gary and Ed Oliver are two draftees who could play immediatley while the 2019 free agent defensive tacke crop is strong with the likes of Geno Atkins, Grady Jarrett, Ndamukong Suh, and more.

### Wide Receiver

Despite signing Jarvis Landry in the offseason, the corps is still lacking a big receiver and red zone threat as well as depth. Dez Bryant remains a free agent and is in play, but if the team decides to wait until the offseason to address the position, some witty veterans and upcoming college grads will be available. The last first round receiver the Browns took, Corey Coleman, is no longer on an NFL roster, but if the team went for another playmaker in the draft they could hit on an impact player. Landry, Callaway, and Higgins are solid, but there is still a piece missing.

### Edge Rusher

The Browns were unwilling to trade away their future for Khalil Mack but still have a small hole at defensive end opposite Myles Garrett. Emmanuel Ogbah is talented, particularly in the run game, but has dealt with injury issues the past two seasons. Chris Smith played well versus the Jets but is lacking big play ablity. The Browns could take a swing on 2019 free agents such as Demarcus Lawrence and Ezekiel Ansah but I expect them to target another edge rusher with their first round pick. Nick Bosa headlines the group but other potential draftees such as Clelin Ferrel will be a force in the NFL as well.
