With the recent trade of Corey Coleman, the absence of Josh Gordon, and the season ending injury to Ricardo Louis, the Browns could eye a trade for New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. After an offseason in which Beckham Jr. was seen with Browns players multiple times, rumors began to swirl, and while they have died down, I still believe a trade could occur.

Odell is set to be a free agent next season and like Jarvis Landry, it may not take too much for the Browns to aquire Landry's former teammates' talents. Also, the Giants are soon to begin a rebuild, as an aging Eli Manning is no longer who he once was and the team is missing pieces to contend. The Giants may look to sell out on their star receiver and start over. If the Browns could aquire Beckham at any cost and resign him, it would be worth it and the team would boast the best receiving corps in the league.

Imagine Tyrod Taylor slinging the ball to Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr. If you said this last season, I would have traded our entire roster for these three players. Landry and Beckham are already great friends and former teammates, Beckham worked out with numerous Browns this offseason, and the Browns current receivers coach previously coached Landry and Beckham at LSU... it's simply a match made in heaven and to a Browns fan, John Dorsey is god.
