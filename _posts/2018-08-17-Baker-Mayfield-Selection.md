When the Browns found out they had the first overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft, the consensus around the league was that the franchise had to select a quarterback. The team decided on Baker Mayfield and made him their first overall pick on April 26th, but was this the right choice, did the Browns need to select a quarterback?

<br>

Let me start by saying that I loved the choice and believe Mayfield can and will develop into an NFL starter, but with the aquisition of Tyrod Taylor and the signing of Drew Stanton, was the selection of the former Heisman winner neccessary, or could the team have addressed other issues. The Browns signed Carlos Hyde and drafted Nick Chubb in the second round, but should they have instead chased Saquon Barkley, the Penn State standout and generational talent? Who knows, it will be multiple years before a decision on their pick can be made.

The Browns have had a history of trading down in drafts, they famously passed on Carson Wentz in 2016, and while the media placed pressure on the team to select a quarterback at #1, trading down could have been a better idea. The first overall pick is coveted by all 31 other teams in the league, and if the Browns had made it available, the return could have been enourmous. The Browns had glaring needs at left tackle and cornerback, and while the selections of Denzel Ward and Austin Corbett attempted to secure those spots, the team could have traded out of the first pick and had multiple selections in the first round to take whatever player they wished. In the second round there were few tackles remaining, but had the Browns aquired another first round selection, they could have eyed a replacement for Joe Thomas.

Mayfield looks the part, has shined on and off the field, and clearly has the talent to start, but I will leave you with this. Would you rather have a decent quarterback who is still raw and have glaring needs at other positions, or aquire a plethora of picks and bring in 3 or more players who would have an immediate impact and could fill those needs. Personally I believe it depends on the team and while I think the Browns made the right choice, it is still interesting to ponder the idea of Saquon Barkley or other players in a Browns jersey.
