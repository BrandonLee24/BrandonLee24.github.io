The Cleveland Browns have traded wide receiver Corey Coleman to the Buffalo Bills for an undisclosed late round draft pick. Coleman, a former first round draft pick by the Browns in 2016, suffered multiple injuries during his tenure with the team and will look to tap into his potential in Buffalo. With Josh Gordon away from the team currently, the receiving core is limited and vacant. Antonio Callaway will likely start this season in place of Coleman, but the Browns regime likely will seek more options.

Dez Bryant has been linked to the Browns for weeks and with another player out of the picture, the Browns may have to sign the proven veteran. Another solid player, Brandon Coleman, was released from the Saints today and could be brought in. Other free agents and potential trades exist and expect John Dorsey to seek one of these options. If he aquired Jarvis Landry for a 4th and 7th round pick, who knows what could be up his sleeve this time... Odell Beckham Jr.??? Who knows.
