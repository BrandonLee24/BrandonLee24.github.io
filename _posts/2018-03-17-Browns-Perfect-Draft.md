## Round 1
**1**  Sam Darnold  _QB  USC_

Darnold is a phenomenal quarterback with a high upside, and in a quarterback driven league, you must find a franchise quarterback. I am a strong believer in Tyrod Taylor's talents but even if he excells, Darnold can learn and grow and be prepared to take over.

**4**  _TRADE_ Browns trade down, aquiring either the Bills 2 first round picks this year, or the cardinals 1st this year and second and some future picks.

If they are able to attain both the Bills 1st round draft picks, then I would want us to take a corner and an offensive tackle with those 2 picks. If Denzel Ward is available at 12, then it would be a no brainer, but that appears to be unlikely.

## Round 2
**33**  James Washington  _WR OKST_

The talented Washington can begin his career by learning from Jarvis Landry, a phenomenal slot receiver, and in the event Landry goes down with injury, Washington can start at slot. If an outside receiver goes down, Landry slides out and Washington gets an opportunity. Never a bad thing to have a multitude of young weapons.

**35**  Sony Michel  _RB UGA_

While Duke Johnson and Carlos Hyde is a formidable backfield duo, why not bring in an extremely talented Michel who showed off his talent at Georgia, partnering with Nick Chubb, and leading the bulldogs to a championship appearance. He can learn from both veterans and take over someday, as well as increasing camp competition.

**64** Justin Reid  _FS SU_

Coming out of Stanford, Reid is an intriguing prospect and could increase competition with the new aquisition Randall. Reid had 5 interceptions last season and if he excells, Randall could potentially return to cornerback.
