## Wide Receiver

<br>

### Starter: Josh Gordon

After returning to the Browns following multiple years of suspension due to violations of the leagues substance abuse policy, Gordon excited many Browns fans, displaying his athleticism immediatley. Playing in just 5 games, Gordon totalled 18 receptions and 335 yards and illustrated that the 26 year old was still talented. While the Browns must remain cautious with him, Josh Gordon should excell this year if he can avoid substances and injuries, and the addition of Landry will mean more space for Gordon. 

#### Roster Chance: 95%

<br>

### Starter: Jarvis Landry

After trading a 4th and future 7th round pick to the Dolphins, the Browns aquired the talented Jarvis Landry, a proven receiver with 3 straight 900+ yard seasons. Likely to command the slot position, the three time pro bowler reunited with former Receiving coach Adam Gase. In 2017, the former LSU stud had 112 receptions and 9 touchdowns and will be a reliable option for Tyrod Taylor. With his skills Landry will open up other receivers and can excell in short yardage situations. Look for the Browns to use his skills commonly, as well as to sign him to an extension.

#### Roster Chance: 100%

<br>

### Starter: Corey Coleman

The Browns first round pick in 2016 out of Baylor, Coleman has been extremely inconsistent, flashing immense talent before suddenly dropping off and suffering multiple injuries. Playing in just 9 games in 2017, Coleman had a measly 23 receptions for 305 yards, leading to the Browns aquiring new talents. If Coleman is able to progress and stay healthy in his thrid year, he could benefit from playing with Gordon and Landry, but that is a big if.  

#### Roster Chance: 85%

<br>

### Backup: Ricardo Louis

Selected in the 2016 draft when the Browns overhauled receivers, Louis was known for his speed. Unfortunatley, he has never displayed much for the Browns except an extreme inconsistency in catching the ball, something he struggled with in college as well. If Louis is able to progess in his third year and improve his hands, he could be a formidable backup and a solid fill-in if a player goes down with injury. 

#### Roster Chance: 50%

<br>

### Reserve: Jeff Janis

A career backup, Janis has excelled on special teams, sticking on rosters largely due to this. Willing to do the dirty work, Janis likely will make the team, replacing Ricardo Louis or another player on special teams as well as filling in as a backup. With the Packers last season, Janis had just 2 receptions, but was well known for his special teams contributions, leading to Alonzo Highsmith and Elliot Wolfe, former Packers' front office members, to bring him into Cleveland. 

#### Roster Chance: 60%

<br>

### Reserve: Rashard Higgins

A 5th round pick out of Colorado State, Higgins was selected as a backup/developmental project. Able to fill in easily and excell in the slot, Higgins had an outburst agains the Ravens in week 2, racking up 7 catches for 95 yards. Throughout the season he never surpassed 40 yards again, until the final week when he posted a statline consisting of 68 yards and 2 touchdowns. While that was not enough for the Browns to finally win a game last year, Higgins displayed his abilities as well as his inconsistency. If he is to make the team, he will be the backup slot receiver, a position he will likely battle a rookie or another player for. Duke Johnson's ability to play slot also hurts Higgins roster chances.

#### Roster Chance: 40%

<br>

### Reserve: Matt Hazel

Signed by the Browns last December, Hazel never saw the field on offense and remains an outlier to make the roster in 2018. Hazel has only ever recorded 1 reception, for a pitiful 1 yard, in his entire career. Without tremendous improvement, it is very unlikely Hazel is able to make the roster.

#### Roster Chance: 5%

<br>

### Reserve: Devon Cajuste

More of a tight end, Cajuste was brought in for competition in January. A large red zone target, Cajuste has decent speed and long arms, but has never been able to make an impact in the NFL, never recording an NFL statistic. With 4 tight ends and a multitude of receivers, Cajuste will have to grind and claw to make the roster. 

#### Roster Chance: 5%

<br>

### Reserve: Kasen Williams

A suprise cut by the Seahawks this past season, Williams was quickly picked up by the Browns and saw time in 7 games, with 2 starts. Despite being given a chance, Williams only put up 84 yards on 9 receptions and was placed back on the practice squad. The 6'1" receiver out of Washington knowns the Browns and their system but remains an outcast at making the roster, especially as he is aging.

#### Roster Chance: 10%

<br>

### Reserve: C.J. Board

Signed to the Browns practice squad in 2017 and resigned as a free agent in 2018, Board hopes to remaing with the team, but without recording a single offensive statistic in his NFL career, the former Tennessee-Chattanooga player would have to play out of his mind in camp to earn a spot. There are simply too many players in front of Board for him to make the roster.

#### Roster Chance: 3%

<br>

### Reserve: Bug Howard

The 6'4" North Carolina receiver was signed to the Browns practice squad last September and remained there all season. Resigned as a free agent in 2018, Howard will have a chance to display his skills and potential sneak onto the team as a backup and red zone target. While the odds are still stacked against him, Howard could be a sleeper to make the team if he is able to increase his speed and develop in his second NFL season.

#### Roster Chance: 10%

<br>

### Reserve: Larry Pinkard

Entering his second season, Pinkard hopes to stick with the Browns, his 4th team since entering the league in 2015. During that time, Pinkard has only played in 4 games, ammassing just 1 catch for 5 yards while on the Jaguars. After being waived in February, the Browns claimed him and he will compete for a spot as a backup receiver. 

#### Roster Chance: 5%

<br>

### Additional Aquisitions

The Browns went out and signed a 3 time pro bowl receiver in Jarvis Landry, but unless the rest of the group is able to improve and remain on the field, the Browns still need another talent here. Cleveland cannot rely on Josh Gordon or Corey Coleman and bringing in a rookie through the draft would increase competition and depth and improve the options for Tyrod Taylor. With 3 second round picks and plenty more after, the Browns have plenty of chances to target a receiver, and also have the ability to develop them instead of thrusting them into their role.

### Position Grade - B-

While Landry, Gordon, and Coleman is a strong trio, the Browns ar relying too much on unreliable players (Gordon and Coleman). With all three on the field, Taylor should be content and will easily find open options, but there is a great chance at least one of these players misses time this upcoming season. Also, with inconsistent and lackluster performance from their 2016 late draft picks (Higgins and Louis), the Browns are not extremely deep and have a steep drop off in talent after the starters.
