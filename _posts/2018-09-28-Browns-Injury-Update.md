## Damarious Randall (S)

<br>

Randall has been stellar this season but has been dealing with multiple injuries. This week its been his heal and he has not practiced yet this week, staying on the sidelines while wearing a boot. Randall suited up last week versus the Jets and expect him to do so again.

<br>

## James Burgess (LB)

<br>

The former Lousiville linebacker suffered a knee injury last week versus the Jets. He started in place of Christian Kirksey but left the game early. He has yet to practice this week and seems unlikely to play versus the Raiders. 

<br>

## Tyrod Taylor (QB) 

<br>

After suffering a concussion and leaving early last week, Taylor lost his starting job and now hopes to hold down the backup role. The former Buffalo Bill returned to practice Thursday and was a limited participant. If he is cleared and gets through concussion protocal, Taylor will likely backup Baker Mayfield.

<br>

## Emmanuel Ogbah (DE)

<br>

Ogbah has missed the past two weeks after suffering an ankle injury versus the Steelers. The former Oregon State product will return this week and lineup across from Myles Garrett. With Larry Ogunjobi wreaking havoc inside, Ogbah will add to a talented group that has suprised many teams this year. 

<br>

## Christian Kirksey (LB)

<br>

A team captain, Kirksey missed the last 2 games with a shoulder and ankle injury. He was not impressive week 1 versus the Steelers but hopes to return to form. These past 2 weeks were the first Kirksey has missed in 5 seasons in the league but as a limited participant the past 2 days, Kirksey is likely to return versus the Raiders.

<br>

## Seth Devalve

<br>

After missing the entire preseason, Devalve has yet to be active in the first 3 weeks. He has been a limited participant the past 2 days and could make his debut this week. The Browns do not need to rush Devalve and his hamstring injury as David Njoku, Darren Fells, and Orson Charles have been sufficient.

<br>

Desmond Harrison, Myles Garrett, and Jarvis Landry have been full participants in practice despite dealing with little knicks and injuries. All three are set to start versus the Raiders.
