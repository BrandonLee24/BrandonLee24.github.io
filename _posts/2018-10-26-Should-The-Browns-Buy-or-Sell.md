As the team prepares for week 8 verus the Steelers, John Dorsey finds himself pressed to make the decision as to whether to buy or sell. In the National Football League, blockbuster trades are relatively uncommon and the trade deadline is less discussed than in other professional leagues such as the MLB. The 2-4-1 Browns have a young talented team and below we debate whether to buy or sell.

## Tyrod Taylor - Sell

<br>

After just 3 starts, Tyrod Taylor was spelled of his starting job and has yet to play ever since. With veteran Drew Stanton on the roster, Taylor is expendable and the Browns should look for a return on the 3rd round pick they traded to aquire Taylor. The Jaguars are the most prominent contending team in need of a quarterback and John Dorsey should looks for a 5th or 6th round pick in return for the former Virginia Tech standout. 

<br>

## Seth Devalve - Sell

<br>

Devalve was the second leading receiver last year but has barely seen the field other than on special teams this season. The former 4th round selection has talent to play in the league but finds himself burried in the depth chart. Out of Princeton, Devalve is a wise player who has solid hands and excels as a route runner. With tight ends underperforming this year, contending teams could seek the Browns 4th string tight end and John Dorsey could get a 6th round pick in return.

<br>

## Allen Hurns - Buy

<br>

At just 26 years old, Hurns was brought into Dallas with high expectations but has yet to hit a stride. Last week he had 5 catches for 74 yards and proved he is still capable when given opportunities, but with the Cowboys recent aquisition of Amari Cooper, Hurns is falling on the depth chart and could be expendable. The Browns receivers have been lacking this year and have suffered numerous injuries. Jarvis Landry could use another solid reciever and John Dorsey has to get rookie Baker Mayfield another option to throw to.

<br>

## Haason Reddick - Buy

<br>

The former first round pick continues to see his playing time diminished with the Cardinals and could be aquired for a mere 5th round selection. The Browns have to eye another pass rusher and Reddick could be just that. If Dorsey wants to take a stab at a youthful prospect, the 24 year old Reddick could be just that.

<br>

Whether the Browns win or lose this Sunday, they should take a look into these propositions, removing veterans and those whom have minimal impacts on the team and aquiring youth and prospects. At a minimum, John Dorsey should intrigue Browns fans with 1 trade before the deadline arrives, most likely the exit of Tyrod Taylor.
