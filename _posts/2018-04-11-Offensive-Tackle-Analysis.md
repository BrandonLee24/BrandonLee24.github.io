## Offensive Tackle

<br>

### Starter: Shon Coleman

Selected in the third round of the 2016 draft, Coleman earned the nod as the starting right tackle last season and hopes to win the competition to be Joe Thomas' replacement at left tackle this season. The 6'5" former Auburn lineman was mediocre last year, being targeted by pass rushers and suffering multiple sacks. While he did display talent as a run blocker, Coleman will have to improve steadily to remain a starter this season, especially as a pass blocker.

#### Roster Chance: 90%

### Starter: Chris Hubbard

Following his former offensive coordinator Todd Haley, Hubbard left Pittsburg to join the Browns and seems to be a lock to start at right tackle. Hubbard started 10 games last year and displayed enough for the Browns to be content on signing him to a 5 year 36+ million dollar contract. Hubbard was the "6th" man last season for the Steelers, earning starting time when other lineman suffered injuries, but appears set to start this season for the Browns.

#### Roster Chance: 99%

### Backup: Roderick Johnson

Johnson, a 5th round developmental selection last season, spent the year on the injured reserve. This season, Johnson hopes to improve and earn the spot as the backup left tackle. At Florida State, the 6'7" Johnson was so talented he forced former Browns lineman Cameron Erving to switch positions. Johnson will have the chance to compete for the starting left tackle spot but seems likely to be a backup this year if he is able to fully recover from his injury.

#### Roster Chance: 75%

### Backup: Donald Stephenson

Signed by the Browns in March, 29 year old Stephenson was aquired to be a backup, insurance lineman for the Browns. The vetran from Oklahoma will compete in camp and will need to display some ability to earn a job as a backup over other younger players.

#### Roster Chance: 50%

<br>

### Reserve: Christian Schneider

Schneider was signed by the Browns in January, landing him his first NFL contract after going undrafted out of Cal-Davis. A longshot to make the roster, Schneider will hope he displays enough potential and youth for the Browns to keep him on the roster. 

#### Roster Chance: 5%

<br>

### Reserve: Victor Salako

Signed to the Browns practice squad last October, Salako was resigned as a free agent and will hope to stick on the roster this season. The 24 year old showed enough for the Browns to bring him back but likely will leave the team after camp as the Browns have youth and talent at the position already.

#### Roster Chance: 10%

<br>

### Alternate: Spencer Drango

Filling in at left tackle when Joe Thomas went down with a season ending injury, Drango struggled, suffering double digit sacks in only 10 starts. Drango was drafted in the 5th round in 2016 to be a versatile backup and developmental guard, and while he can fill in at offensive tackle, the position he played in college at Baylor, Drango is better fit as an offensive guard.

#### Roster Chance: 90%

### Additional Aquisitions

The Browns added Hubbard but with the retirement of Joe Thomas leaves a void at the left tackle position for the first time since 2007. Shon Coleman has displayed ability but needs improvement in order to be a solid starter on an NFL team. The Browns should look to either trade out of the 4th overall pick to add an offensive lineman later in the first round, trade back into the first round, or draft an offensive lineman with one of their second round picks. At a minimum, the Browns need to bring in more competition to camp to compete and push Shon Coleman.

### Position Grade: C

The Brown have potential at the position and added a quality player in Hubbard, but with the departure of Joe Thomas, the group lacks leadership and a surefire blindside blocker. If Coleman is able to improve his pass blocking and Hubbard proves himself as a starter, the Browns front 5 could be a strong point for years to come.
