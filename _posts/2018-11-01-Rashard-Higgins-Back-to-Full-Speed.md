The Cleveland Browns receiver corps has been lacking as of late but if Rashard Higgins is able to return, the team could greatly benefit. Higgins has been sidelined the past 3 weeks with a sprained MCL but has been back at practice this week. It is not a guarantee that he plays this week versus the Cheifs but Baker Mayfield and the offense are hopeful he does.

The 2016 5th round selection has 16 catches for 244 yards and 1 touchdown on the year. He shined throughout camp and was able to take a lot of attention off Jarvis Landry. Antonio Callaway has started in his place since the injury.

Baker Mayfield needs all the help he can get; the offensive line has struggled and the Browns lead the NFL in drops. Higgins' return and sure hands could greatly help this offense and increase their odds of beating the 7-1 Chiefs.
