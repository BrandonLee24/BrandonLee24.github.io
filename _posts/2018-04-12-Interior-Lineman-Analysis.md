## Interior Lineman

<br>

### Starter: Joel Bitonio

Signed to a massive extension last season, Bitonio proved himself and was one of, if not the best lineman on the Browns. Bitonio displayed skill in pass and run blocking and was able to effectively return from an injury which plagued his previous year. Entering 2018, Bitonio will be a sure fire starter, but if the Browns do not feel confident in their left tackle, Bitonio could return to the position he played in college.

#### Roster Chance: 100%

<br>

### Starter: J.C. Tretter

Aquired after departing the Packers, Tretter was a solid center for the Browns, stabalizing the position after the woes of Cam Erving. Tretter was solid but could definitley be improved, particularly in the passing game. His athleticism was helpful to the front line as well and with another season of playing with Zeitler and Bitonio, the interior lineman for the Browns should be a strong point.

#### Roster Chance: 95%

<br>

### Starter: Kevin Zeitler

The Browns signed Zeitler from the Bengals to start and command the right guard poition and he did just that last season, playing extremely well all season and commanding the position all year. Zeitler will remain a mainstay at the position for years to come and will continue to lead and help the rest of the members of the Browns offense.

#### Roster Chance: 100%

<br>

### Backup: Spencer Drango

Drango, who filled in for Joe Thomas at left tackle last season, is a capable player who is best suited at guard. While he did fill in for every game after Thomas went down with a season ending injury, the former 5th round pick struggled, particularly in the passing game. Drafted as a developmental player, Drango can be a servicable backup who should continue to improve.

#### Roster Chance: 85%

<br>

### Backup: Austin Reiter

Reiter saw the field for very few snaps last season, mostly in short yardage situation, but the young center once displayed potential which excited many Browns fans. Although it was just one game Reiter was phenomenal in a start last year before suffering an injury and if he is able to replicate that ability in camp, he will be around for 2018 at least.

#### Roster Chance: 60%

<br>

### Reserve: Geoff Gray

The 23 year old Gray was signed by the Browns from the Jets practice squad in 2017 and still remains with the team, competing in camp for a backup guard position. The 6'5" mammouth out of Manitoba, Gray has never played an offensive snap in his career, but his youth could aid in him sneaking a roster spot or sticking on the practice squad. 

#### Roster Chance: 25%

<br>

### Reserve: Chris Barker

An undrafted free agent signed by the Dolphins in 2013, Barker now finds himself on his third team after being repetitively claimed, waved, and added to the practice squad for the Patriots for 3 years. Gray was claimed by Cleveland in May but spent the season on the IR. Baker hopes to stick with his third team in 5 years with the Browns and play a backup role on the interior offensive line.

#### Roster Chance: 30%

<br>

### Additional Aquisitions

The Browns have a very strong defensive line and multiple servicable backups whom should stick with the team for years to come due to their youth. The interior offensive line remains a strong point for the Browns offense, particularly in the run game, and are solid throughout. If there was one weakness, it would be at center, as Tretter has suffered injuries before and had a few problems last season as well.

### Position Grade: A-

If this group is able to stay healthy, they are one of the best in the league. Bitonio, Tretter, and Zeitler would all start on most, if not all NFL teams, and a youthful depth chart with Drango and Reiter provides backup if any injuries do occur. Tyrod Taylor and Carlos Hyde will grow to love these big men up front.
