## The Point

While training camp can be enjoyable, that's not the point. Players need to grind, developing skills, learning new traits, and forming bonds. Those who don't, whom complain about putting in work and getting better every day should be cut, no matter if they are a 10 year veteran or first round pick, a player with a losing attitude will instill that on the whole team. Duke Johnson, despite never receiving enough praise, always goes and works hard, doing all he can to help the players around him improve. Whether he is needed at running back or receiver, he is willing to do anything to help the team; a mental state every other player should have as well. Tyrod Taylor, a veteran whom was in the playoffs last year could opt to not help Baker Mayfield and ensure he doesn't get beaten out for his starting job, but instead he continues to improve and help those around him do the same. 

Bill Belichick and the Patriots do not condone bs at their training camp, their players rarely ever are involved in scandals or mishaps. The Browns should instill this in their locker room as well, no more crap, no more Kenny Britt and players whom simply play for the money and have no more motivation to get better, no more losing attitude.
