The Browns wrapped up their 18th and final day of training camp today, but as the team headed out after a day of work, questions still remain. Below we dive into the major question marks surrounding the Cleveland Browns following camp.

## Josh Gordon

The Superstar receiver returned to practice Saturday but has yet to participate with the team. Missing the first 2 weeks, Gordon will have a lot to catch up on, especially as the team hired a new offensive coordinator this offseason (Todd Haley) who will be imposing his own playbook. Gordon appears to be in decent shape, posting numerous videos on his instagram of him working out when away from the team, but he has not engaged in any team activities yet. Whether Gordon will be ready for week 1 against the Steelers is unknown but Browns coaches and fans can only hope the 2013 NFL receiving yards leader can return to form.

## Offensive Line

When Joel Bitonio slid out wide to left tackle, the whole Browns offense was affected. Austin Corbett took over the starting left guard position while Shon Coleman fell all the way to the teams second team right tackle. Bitonio and Corbett have played well and the coaches believe in both to succeed but questions still loom as the duo has yet to play a true NFL snap together. Starting right guard Kevin Zeitler has also been out, nursing a calf injury the majority of the offseason. Zeitler has never played with new right tackle Chris Hubbard in a game yet so when he returns, the offensive line will still need to mold and work out the kinks.

## Defensive Tackle

The defensive front is youthful and talented but there are clear question marks at defensive tackle. With the trade of Danny Shelton, it was clear the Browns believed in Trevon Coley, Larry Ogunjobi, Caleb Brantley, and Jamie Meder. Coley has been out most of camp, suffering an early ankle injury, and while the rest have filled in respectably, the group lacks depth and proven players. There is clear talent but injuries and youth are scary and it is difficult to have true faith in the position group.

## Antonio Callaway

A fourth round pick this year, Callaway earned a starting position this offseason and has shined in preseason games. The former Florida Gator, however, was cited with marijuana possesion during camp and did not tell the coaches, a decision which saw him punished by playing virtually as much as possible in the Browns first preseason game. Callaway did not back down but his off the field struggles are concerning, especially as Josh Gordon is working his way back the group is quite thin. Callaway has starting potential, possibly even immediatley, but there are numerous question marks surrounding him.

## Rotations

Ah, finally a good question mark. The Browns added tremendous talent this offseason, through signings, trades, and the draft, but with all that added talent, how groups will rotate and split snaps is intriguing. The running backs and linebackers are key areas where the Browns possess numerous skilled players and how they utilize them all will be interesting. Also, how the snaps at strong saftey, a competition between Jabrill Peppers and Derrick Kindred, play out will be noted as well.
