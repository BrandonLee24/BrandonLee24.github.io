## Kirk Cousins

Cousins leads the free agent quarterbacks, and despite only holding a career 24-23 record as a starter, the former Washington Redskins quarterback is likely to be the highest paid NFL player. The former Michigan State superstar was taken by the Redskins in the 4th round, in the same draft when they took Robert Griffin III.  Last year, Cousins boasted a 64.3 completion percentage for 4093 yards, with 27 touchdowns to 13 interceptions. He has a career completion percentage of 65.5 and has started all 16 games for Washington the past 3 years, leading them to 9, 8, and 7 win seasons. All in all, Cousins is a competent quarterback, and in a league desperate for any taste of skill at the position, expect a simply above average player to become the highest paid.

#### Expected Team: New York Jets

The Jets have a youthful roster and the 6th pick in the draft, and with their cap situation, close to 100 million, expect them to literally throw money at Cousins.

## A.J. McCarron

McCarron, out of Alabama, has been granted a restricted free agent by an arbitrator, likely ending his tenure as a Cincinnati Bengal. Despite playing in only 3 games last year, totaling a measly 14 pass attempts, teams appear to be willing to take a chance on the career backup. The 27 year old has a 64.7 completion percentage and 6 touchdowns in his career, all coming in the 2015 season. The former 5th round pick became an unrestricted free agent on February 15th and seems destined to sign elsewhere, caping off his 4 year tenure with the Bengals.

#### Expected Team: Cleveland Browns

The Cleveland Brown, owners of an 0-16 record, attempted to trade for McCarron at the trade deadline, but failed to do so. Now that they will be able to sign McCarron for free, I expect him to reunite with Jackson. If the Browns do sign McCarron, expect them to trade out of the 1st pick to aquire more talent to surround their new quarterback.
