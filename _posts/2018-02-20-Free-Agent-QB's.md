## Kirk Cousins

Cousins leads the free agent quarterbacks, and despite only holding a career 24-23 record as a starter, the former Washington Redskins quarterback is likely to be the highest paid NFL player. The former Michigan State superstar was taken by the Redskins in the 4th round, in the same draft when they took Robert Griffin III.  Last year, Cousins boasted a 64.3 completion percentage for 4093 yards, with 27 touchdowns to 13 interceptions. He has a career completion percentage of 65.5 and has started all 16 games for Washington the past 3 years, leading them to 9, 8, and 7 win seasons. All in all, Cousins is a competent quarterback, and in a league desperate for any taste of skill at the position, expect a simply above average player to become the highest paid.

#### Expected Team: New York Jets

The Jets have a youthful roster and the 6th pick in the draft, and with their cap situation, close to 100 million, expect them to literally throw money at Cousins.
